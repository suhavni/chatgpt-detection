Geography Is One of the Essential Disciplines in School Reflective,"Geography is a very important discipline which teaches us to understand the basic rules of our world. From geography classes we know about climate and landform forces, cultural and political structure of different countries and nations.

This course was very organization and I got to know a lot of interesting and very important things about our world. I am quite satisfied with my learning achievements, since I reached all my learning goals. Now I have the understanding of the main forces of the earth, the ocean and the spheres, which make up the peculiarities of climate all over the world.

I also learned about different political and cultural traditions of some countries. Of course, I did not cover all the amount of countries and nations, which is impossible even for such substantial course, but I have the common generalized knowledge of the major countries and which is even more important, I know the ways how and where I can find the necessary information.

The most exciting part for me was a cultural part of the course, when we learned traditions of different people, which is really interesting. The most disputable, to my mind, part of the course is still pollution issues and energy issues, which are quite connected. To my mind this part needs more precise attention, but I’d like to discuss it a bit later.

Apart from receiving definite amount of necessary knowledge I received something more. I broaden my common knowledge and now I have more definite ideas about what I’d like to get to know further. My personal achievement, which I attained during the course, to my mind, is my ability to organize my own study and the fact that I obtained such a considerable amount of information, which is a very good basis for further education. I became a geographically literal person, if I may say so, and I bear in mind all the concepts and principles of the geography.

All these achievements made me understand that this course of geography opens the whole world in front of the young people, schoolchildren. This course is very substantial, touching all the main aspects of life of the earth, including soil, water, nature and people. Now I see that geography not only deals with location of different countries but provides deep knowledge of the central laws of our existence.

The course of geography is very broad; it is not like chemistry for instance which is only preoccupied with chemical elements. Geography embraces a very wide spectrum of issues beginning with natural forces, and coming to consideration of organization of peoples’ life and correlation between the nature and people.

I’d like to stress that the course is very rich in information, though, to my mind, it is possible to add some more discussion concerning the problems of energy and pollution. Modern life brings into forefront these very issues, since the amount of people grows and, thus, the amount of different polluting sources also grows, but the amount of energy sources vanishes too rapidly.

Thus, from very early years we should pay a lot of attention to these issues, and we should try to find different ways to overcome these problems. Geography course contributes greatly into these issues solving, since it gets prepared new generations which are to build new perfect world.","Geography is one of the essential disciplines taught in school. It is a subject that explores the world and provides a deep understanding of the natural and human processes that shape our planet. Geography involves studying physical landscapes, cultures, and societies around the world, and it teaches students how to analyze and interpret spatial data. This reflective essay explores my experience with geography in school and how it has impacted my understanding of the world around me.

During my early years in school, I did not have a strong interest in geography. I viewed it as just another subject that I had to pass. However, as I progressed through my academic journey, I began to appreciate the subject more. I realized that geography was more than just memorizing countries and their capitals. Instead, it was about exploring and understanding the world, both physically and culturally.

One aspect of geography that stood out to me was the study of physical landscapes. Through geography, I learned about the formation of mountains, rivers, and other natural features. I also learned about natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods. This knowledge gave me a greater appreciation of the natural world and the forces that shape it. I began to view nature as a complex and beautiful system that deserves our protection and respect.

Another important aspect of geography is the study of cultures and societies. Through geography, I learned about the diversity of cultures around the world and how they shape our global community. I studied different religions, traditions, and lifestyles, and I gained a greater appreciation of the richness of human experience. I also learned about the social and economic factors that influence communities, and how they shape the world around us. This knowledge gave me a broader perspective on social issues and a greater understanding of the interconnectedness of our world.

In addition to learning about physical landscapes and cultures, geography also taught me how to analyze and interpret spatial data. I learned how to read maps, charts, and graphs, and how to analyze data to make informed decisions. This skill has proven valuable in many areas of my life, from navigating new cities to analyzing financial data for work. I appreciate the analytical skills that geography has provided me with, and I feel better equipped to make informed decisions in my personal and professional life.

Overall, my experience with geography in school has been transformative. It has opened my eyes to the world around me and given me a greater appreciation of its complexity and beauty. Geography has taught me valuable analytical skills that I use in my daily life, and it has broadened my perspective on social issues and global interconnectedness.

Through the study of physical landscapes, cultures, and societies, students gain a broader perspective on the world around them. Geography also teaches valuable analytical skills that can be applied in many areas of life. I am grateful for my experience with geography in school, and I believe that it is an essential subject that should be taught to all students.",Personal,7
The Right to Abortion,"Arguments and counter arguments have been fronted with such fierceness and eloquence for and against abortion from different quarters of the social and spiritual divide. Abortion, an age-old phenomenon is defined as a premature termination of the unborn. Far and wide, arguments have been presented in various forms that span the general to specific issues.

It is a controversial topic that spans the social, moral, medical, and legal fields. The hostility against abortion affords counter arguments that justify its legality. Therefore, abortion is the right of every woman to decide when it should occur.

Despite the controversy surrounding a specific and working definition of when life begins, it is well worth noting that life begins a few weeks to birth. Before conception, the fetus entirely depends on the mother and any circumstances besides abortion may lead to its termination.

In addition to that, the growing embryo is not a fully developed functional human being therefore the argument that life begins at conception is preposterous and purely religious. That notwithstanding, the interest of the family and the mother are of paramount importance in this debate.

A mother should not be compelled to painfully bring up a child for eighteen years without due preparation and the social and psychological consequences faced by the unprepared mother. Some of the strong reasons presented by proponents of abortion include circumstances such as rape, mistaken pregnancies due to the failure of contraceptives, the threat to a mother’s life if she continues with a pregnancy, a deformed and disabled foetus, and work place career advancements.

On the other hand opponents of abortion argue that life begins at conception and terminating the foetus’ life amounts to a crime against humanity. They assert that terminating the life of a foetus at conception or during pregnancy amounts to killing a human being and lay emphasis on the foetus as a human being with all the fundamental rights of a person.

They argue that it is the killing of an innocent defenseless person in society when carrying out an abortion. They further assert that life is a God given gift and no one is entitled to terminate it under any circumstances.

In addition to that, opponents of abortion argue that human beings are supposed to show commitment to life of any form. They should be caring for the frail and weak in society and that spans the unborn fetus. They further affirm that happiness to life does not consist of money alone, but a complete and responsible life. Abortion is seen as a sin against the unborn as enshrined in the fifth Decalogue of the Ten Commandments in the religious eye.

Despite the arguments and counter arguments surrounding the issue on abortion, the age-old phenomenon is the legitimate right of the affected woman to decide to terminate it or continue with it. The life of the mother is far more important than the unborn foetus and everything should be done to preserve it. The right of the mother is entirely justified.

","The right to abortion has been a topic of controversy for decades. Proponents argue that women have the right to make decisions about their own bodies, while opponents argue that abortion is morally wrong and violates the right to life of the fetus. Despite these opposing views, the right to abortion has been upheld as a constitutional right in the United States since the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade in 1973.

One of the primary arguments in favor of the right to abortion is that it is essential to women's reproductive freedom and autonomy. Women have the right to make their own decisions about whether or not to have children, and the ability to obtain an abortion is crucial in ensuring that they have the ability to exercise that right. Without access to safe and legal abortion services, women may be forced to resort to dangerous and potentially life-threatening methods to terminate a pregnancy, or may be unable to exercise their right to control their own bodies altogether.

Opponents of abortion, on the other hand, argue that fetuses have a right to life that must be protected. They often frame their opposition to abortion in terms of a belief that life begins at conception, and therefore that abortion is tantamount to murder. Some also argue that allowing women to have abortions perpetuates a culture of promiscuity and moral decay.

Despite these arguments, it is important to recognize that the right to abortion is essential to protecting women's health and ensuring their autonomy. Abortion is a safe and common medical procedure, and it is one of the most common procedures performed in the United States. According to the Guttmacher Institute, approximately one in four women will have an abortion by the age of 45. Moreover, studies have consistently shown that women who are denied access to abortion services experience higher rates of poverty, poor health, and mental health problems than those who are able to obtain the procedure.

It is also important to recognize that the right to abortion is not just about individual autonomy, but also about social justice. Women who are most affected by restrictions on abortion access are often those who are already marginalized and disadvantaged, such as women of color, low-income women, and those living in rural areas with limited access to healthcare. By restricting access to abortion, policymakers are effectively denying these women the ability to control their own bodies and make decisions about their own futures.

Of course, there are valid concerns about the potential ethical implications of abortion. However, it is important to recognize that these concerns are not absolute and must be balanced against other considerations, such as women's health and autonomy. Additionally, it is worth noting that there are many different beliefs about when life begins, and that these beliefs are often shaped by cultural and religious traditions. As such, it is not appropriate for the state to impose one particular belief about the beginning of life on all individuals.

In conclusion, the right to abortion is a critical component of women's reproductive freedom and autonomy. By allowing women to make decisions about their own bodies and futures, we are ensuring that they have the ability to exercise their full range of human rights. While there are certainly ethical concerns associated with abortion, it is important to recognize that these must be weighed against other considerations, such as women's health and social justice. Ultimately, the right to abortion is an essential component of a just and equitable society.

Pride in Ancient Greek,"This paper discusses the character and behavior of two Heroes in the Iliad with the aim of explaining the Geeks’ concept of pride. Considering the lives of Achilles and Patroclus, as presented in the Iliad, it is clear that for ancient Greek heroes, honor meant everything.

In actual sense, a Greek warrior or man would rather choose to die than be ashamed or embarrassed by someone else. Honor meant so much to them that they did everything to attain it. Honor was the lifetime goal of every ancient Greek man and people sought it at all costs.

Unfortunately, their concept of honor could be interpreted as foolhardy pride in our days. As will be shown through focus on Achilles and Patroclus, had they not been driven by their pride, they would not have met with their downfall; the way they did.

Achilles was a great Greek warrior who had helped the Greek with his might and skills. Like all Greek men, he wanted to do his people proud and the people were proud of him. However, his desire for honor leads to his downfall when he confronts the king over a woman. He had been given the woman as a prize for his valor in war against the Trojans.

When the king takes away the woman (prize he had given to Achilles), Achilles out of pride challenges the king and refuses to go to war. His decision not to go to war against the Trojans is what prompted Patroclus to pick up his armor to face Hector. Moreover, apart from refusing to fight for the Greek, Achilles out of pride chooses to argue or disobey the gods.

Priam, his mother intervenes, and again out of pride, Achilles chooses glory over a long life. In the life of Achilles, one can see pride or honor being prioritized over every other important thing. For instance, it is out of pride that Achilles refuses to go to battle prompting his friend Patroclus to stand in to lead the Greek armies against the Trojans.

Patroclus, just like Achilles, was a great warrior. He was one of the great warriors from the Greek side and would have been instrumental in defeating Hectors on behalf of the Achaeans.

However, desire for honor and pride got the better of him. Hectors was more skilled and the only person who could match him from the Greek side was Achilles. Patroclus had been warned against engaging or fighting Hector because he was not his match. However, as it would have been expected of any Greek hero, Patroclus goes against every warning that he should not engage Hectors in a battle.

Having won a number of battles, he is so full of himself that he thinks not engaging or fighting Hectors is a cowardly act. Secondly, he also stands up to Hectors to save himself the shame of having failed his people in a battle. Consequently, this willfulness leads him into dying at the hands of Hectors.

In conclusion, from the two examples given, it is clear that the Greek priced pride over all other values such as safety. It can also be noted that desire for honor and pride, among Greek heroes, was what propelled them to great heights but also what led to their downfall. In search for honor, the heroes did their people proud but out of pride they often became willful and untactful leading to their downfall.

","The concept of pride, or hubris in Ancient Greek, was central to the cultural and social norms of the time. The portrayal of pride in the Iliad, an epic poem written by Homer, serves as a window into the values and beliefs of Ancient Greek society. In this essay, I will explore how pride was portrayed in the Iliad, and the impact it had on the characters and events in the story.

Pride was a highly valued trait in Ancient Greek society. It was seen as a sign of strength, honor, and courage. However, excessive pride, or hubris, was seen as a dangerous flaw that could lead to downfall and destruction. This dichotomy is evident in the characters of the Iliad, where pride is portrayed both as a source of strength and a cause of downfall.

One of the most prominent examples of pride in the Iliad is the character of Achilles. He is the greatest warrior of the Greek army and is renowned for his strength and skill. However, his excessive pride and stubbornness lead to conflict with his fellow warriors and ultimately lead to his downfall. Achilles’ refusal to fight in the Trojan War after being slighted by Agamemnon is a clear example of his pride getting the best of him. He puts his personal honor above the well-being of his fellow soldiers and the war effort. This decision has severe consequences, including the death of his best friend Patroclus, which ultimately leads to his own death.

Another example of pride in the Iliad is the character of Agamemnon, the leader of the Greek army. He is proud of his position of power and believes that he deserves respect and obedience from his subordinates. This pride leads to conflict with Achilles, as he takes the latter’s war prize, Briseis, as his own. Agamemnon’s actions demonstrate the dangers of excessive pride, as they lead to discord and division within the Greek army, weakening their ability to fight the Trojans.

In contrast to these negative examples of pride, there are also positive portrayals of pride in the Iliad. The character of Hector, the greatest warrior of the Trojan army, is a good example of this. He is proud of his city, his family, and his heritage, and his pride motivates him to fight bravely against the Greeks. Hector’s pride is tempered by his sense of duty to his people, which ultimately leads to his death at the hands of Achilles. However, his bravery and honor in battle are seen as positive attributes and are celebrated by both the Trojans and the Greeks.

In conclusion, the portrayal of pride in the Iliad provides insight into the values and beliefs of Ancient Greek society. Pride was seen as a double-edged sword, capable of providing strength and honor but also leading to downfall and destruction. The characters of Achilles, Agamemnon, and Hector demonstrate the positive and negative aspects of pride, and their stories serve as cautionary tales about the dangers of excessive hubris. The Iliad is a testament to the enduring impact of Ancient Greek culture and its influence on Western literature and thought.",Analytical,1
Quality Management for Organizational Excellence,"Quality management is a continuous organizational process which is aimed at meeting and exceeding the customers’ requirements through specific processes and an organization wide participation in planning and implementation. The elements of quality management include focus on the customer, strategy, teamwork, continual commitment and a scientific approach. Other elements are continuous improvement, training and education, control and obsession with quality.

The customer is the most important aspect of an organization because all activities that the firm conducts are geared toward the supply of goods or services to the customer. The internal customer is just as important as the external customer. The internal customer refers to individuals that are members of an organization who contribute to the final product that is offered to the customer.
Since processes are what determine the end product, it is necessary to continually improve them. When set objects are met, new objectives should be set for great levels of quality. Organizations that practice quality management are strategic in that they aim to be in line with set organizational objectives.
Quality management also takes into consideration the future of the organization and activities of competitors. The organization is obsessed with meeting the quality standards that are required by the customers. In this way, the employees desire to do their best all the time.
The focus on quality is not just for the short term but for the long run as well. In order for the entire organization to be one-minded in quality, all employees have to be trained and educated on quality management. The quality management process requires that there be adequate control from top management, although autonomy is encouraged. A scientific approach is used in setting targets, benchmarking and performance appraisal.
Kaoru Ishikawa was a pioneer in the subject of quality management. He emphasized on the quality management elements of customer focus and education of employees. His doctrine pointed to employee training as the basis for the commencement and maintenance of quality management in an organization.
He came up with quality circles which enable employees to be involved in problem solving while increasing their ability to identify opportunities for growth. The development of these elements made Kaoru Ishikawa successful because organizations have been able to increase revenue and deal with competition in the market.
Quality management is very useful in today’s market environment. Competition is one of the biggest challenges facing firms. Market leader should employ quality market so as to maintain there position in terms of market share and profits. On the other hand, small organizations that are growing or trying to penetrate the market, would benefit greatly from quality management.
Customers in the current market are very complex and knowledgeable. They know what they want and expect companies to provide goods and services which meet certain standards. Quality management would enable a firm to meet the customers’ needs thus ensuring that there will be repeat purchases and loyalty to the brand.
The quality management field is likely to grow in future. More efficient and effective system will be developed so as to improve the position of the firm in the future market. The focus may be on external factors in the market such as changes in technology, globalization and environmental concerns.


","In today's competitive business world, quality has become a crucial factor for success. Organizations that strive for excellence in quality management have a competitive edge and are better able to satisfy their customers' needs. Quality management is an approach that focuses on continuous improvement, customer satisfaction, and effective management of resources. This essay will discuss the principles of quality management, their applications in organizational excellence, and the role of leadership in quality management.

Quality management is based on several principles that are critical to its success. These principles include customer focus, leadership, involvement of people, process approach, continuous improvement, factual approach to decision making, and mutually beneficial supplier relationships. These principles form the foundation of quality management and guide organizations in achieving excellence in their operations. For instance, a customer-focused approach ensures that an organization meets and exceeds its customers' expectations, which is critical to success in any industry. Similarly, a process approach ensures that organizations have a structured and efficient approach to delivering their products and services.

Organizations that have embraced quality management have seen improvements in their operations, increased customer satisfaction, and enhanced financial performance. Quality management provides a framework for organizations to achieve excellence in their operations, products, and services. For example, an organization that implements a quality management system can identify and eliminate waste, reduce errors and defects, and streamline its processes. This can lead to improved efficiency, reduced costs, and improved customer satisfaction.

Leadership plays a critical role in quality management. Leaders must create a culture of quality in their organizations by setting the tone from the top. They must communicate the importance of quality, provide the necessary resources and support, and hold themselves and their teams accountable for achieving excellence in quality management. Leaders must also ensure that the principles of quality management are integrated into the organization's strategy, processes, and operations.

In conclusion, quality management is essential for organizational excellence. Its principles provide a framework for organizations to achieve continuous improvement, customer satisfaction, and effective management of resources. Leaders play a critical role in implementing quality management by creating a culture of quality and ensuring that the principles of quality management are integrated into the organization's strategy, processes, and operations. Organizations that embrace quality management are better positioned to succeed in today's competitive business environment.",Expository,8
The Biomedical Model of Health in Medicine,"Health, illness and treatments have been looked in different ways based on the cultural beliefs and traditions where one belong. Cultures all over the world have created and practiced different kind of healing system and all of these have rational points on how human bodies function normally and abnormally.

Health professionals should integrate diverse cultural concept in dealing to various healing system and modify treatments that put emphasis in giving the best health care that one deserves to have. Multi-ethnic understanding should be taken into consideration because different cultures have their distinct ways in dealing with diseases.

The biomedical model of health focuses on the biological aspect of the individual and uses scientific methods to diagnose and cure an illness. The diagnostic methods and tools are used to restore the physical state of the human body. It sees good health as the absence of pain or freedom from disease and is based on a fact.

While this model focus on the individual, other healing system like the Hmong model, that has little information about the western medical practice, believes that the causes and the cure of illnesses are divided into two parts, the spiritual and non-spiritual aspect.

The story of “The Spirit Catches You and You Fall down” implies that the Hmong sees epilepsy as of divine nature where a spirit enters the body.

This contradicts to what the doctor views that it is merely an illness that needs treatment to stop the seizure. In Hmong model, if the cause of the illness is of spiritual aspect, ancestral worship and ritualistic ceremonies are done by the shaman. In cases where illness is caused by non-spiritual aspect, they seek for traditional cures, and this is where herbal medicine comes in.

This is not only practiced by the Hmong, but also practice by other Southeast Asian cultures. Like in India, they practice the Ayurvedic medical system. Dietary and herbal are part of the treatment scheme because of the belief that it is essential in restoring the balance of mind, body and spirit and this balance is vital in achieving a healthy life.

There are two basic principles of illness causation that explain the rationale behind every healing system. The personalistic and naturalistic principles of illness causation discuss the mode of diagnosis, treatments and other elements that made up the health system.

Personalistic principle is derived from the idea that disease, magic and religion are inseparable. Misfortunes play a part why individual suffer from illness. Diseases occur because of the human and nonhuman intervention, the participation of the powerful being or deity and that illness is a result of the spiritual and moral aspects that are treated by those having magical and supernatural powers.

This is in contrast to the naturalistic principle that views illness in a systematic way. It states that the illness suffered by an individual is not because of misfortunes, magic or religion. The focus of this principle is therapeutic and conforms to the equilibrium model that health and illness is a product of balance and harmony of the human body and the environment.

When the state of balance between human beings and the environment are disrupted or when imbalance occurs, it will result to illness. The principle of equilibrium conforms to this model and is being practice by the Humoral model and the Ayurvedic health system.

The decision process in treating illness is complex because cultural beliefs and social factors are relevant in giving a quality multicultural care. How human beings respond to illness is essential and understanding the concepts of every healing system is vital in combating diseases.","The biomedical model of health is a conceptual framework that has dominated Western medicine for over a century. It views health and illness as purely physical phenomena, with the focus on identifying and treating the underlying biological causes of disease. This approach is based on the assumption that the human body is a machine that can be repaired through medical intervention, and that illness can be cured through the application of scientific knowledge and technology.

The biomedical model emphasizes the importance of objective and measurable data, such as laboratory tests and imaging studies, in the diagnosis and treatment of disease. It also prioritizes the use of pharmaceuticals, surgery, and other medical interventions as the primary means of managing illness. In this model, the role of the physician is to diagnose and treat the disease, rather than to focus on the broader well-being of the patient.

One of the main strengths of the biomedical model is its ability to effectively treat acute medical conditions. The model has led to significant advances in medical technology, pharmaceuticals, and surgical procedures, which have saved countless lives and improved the quality of life for millions of people. The biomedical approach has also led to a better understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying many diseases, which has allowed for the development of more targeted and effective treatments.

However, the biomedical model also has several limitations. One of the most significant criticisms of the model is that it fails to take into account the complex interplay of biological, psychological, social, and environmental factors that contribute to health and illness. For example, many chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer are influenced by lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise, and stress, as well as social and environmental factors such as poverty, pollution, and access to healthcare. The biomedical model tends to ignore these factors, focusing instead on the biological mechanisms of the disease.

Another limitation of the biomedical model is that it can lead to overmedicalization and the unnecessary use of medical interventions. For example, the model may prioritize the use of pharmaceuticals or surgery over lifestyle changes or other non-medical interventions. This can lead to a reliance on medical treatments that may not always be effective or necessary, and can also result in the overuse of healthcare resources.

In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the limitations of the biomedical model and a shift towards a more holistic and patient-centered approach to healthcare. This approach, often referred to as the biopsychosocial model, emphasizes the importance of understanding the complex interplay of biological, psychological, social, and environmental factors that contribute to health and illness. It also emphasizes the importance of patient-centered care, in which the patient's values, preferences, and goals are central to the healthcare process.

In conclusion, the biomedical model of health has played an important role in the development of modern medicine and has led to significant advances in the treatment of many acute medical conditions. However, its narrow focus on biological mechanisms and medical interventions has limited its ability to effectively manage chronic diseases and address the broader social and environmental factors that contribute to health and illness. Moving towards a more holistic and patient-centered approach to healthcare, such as the biopsychosocial model, may be a more effective way to address these complex issues and improve health outcomes for all.",Expository,2
The Reality of China’s Growth,"China’s continuous double digit economic growth may not be sustainable in the long term. The Chinese economy has consistently posted high growth figures even as the rest of the major world economy giants undergo recession. Though probable, such a trend is unlikely to last long and will likely stall in the near future.

One of the reasons postulated for the eventual decline in the Chinese economic growth is that the Chinese economy is highly dependent on foreign demand. Although many Chinese officials try to downplay this interconnectedness with other world economies, the evidence is clear.

Chinese officials go as far as to manipulate international trade figures in order to downplay the emerging fact that, the projected growth may be partly a function of manipulated figures. At the beginning of this year, analysts and critics reported that some Chinese officials had the figures in copper trade altered in order to inflate the import numbers.

Furthermore, as the European and American economies struggle with the mounting debt and perpetual economic crises, China, on the other hand, as the biggest foreign exchange holder of American and European debt, is bound to be drawn into the arising economic uncertainties.

Another reason that analysts believe that the sustained growth of the Chinese economy is impossible is because it defies basic economic growth cycle patterns.

Cycles of economic boom and recession are inevitable in any economy. The reason why the Chinese people have been able to experience the continuous and sustained growth is that, the Chinese government intervenes to cushion its markets from recession. The heavy presence of government in nearly all spheres of the economy also paints a negative picture of the Chinese economy and its long-term prognosis.

The Chinese economy is also heavily industrial and manufacture oriented, pointing to an unwieldy economy that needs to adapt and be nimble in order to survive an uncertain future.

Furthermore, although the Chinese are famed for their entrepreneurial spirit, the policies of the Chinese government sometimes stifle the enterprising pursuits of the Chinese. Many dynamic businesses and firms that mushroom are sometimes quickly ‘swallowed’ or muscled out of business by the major firms that may enjoy the support of the state.

Such practices tend to erode the spirit of entrepreneurship in the long term. China also has a huge labor force that sometimes poses a challenge to the government.

Ingeniously, the Chinese government absorbs the mass labor force into the huge and expanding Chinese service industry, with many hotels employing as many workers as possible. Many of these laborers are usually workers from other sectors of the economy that may have collapsed previously.

Therefore, in conclusion, the continued high growth rate of the Chinese thriftiness is unsustainable in the end. The sustained growth, as has been discussed, is more a function of government policy and interference than a result of exclusive market dynamics at play.

Inevitably, the Chinese economy will soon experience recession that is common to all economies. To what extent the government can cushion its citizens when this happens is an open question. However, in the end, the Chinese are better of preparing for such an eventuality than denying it.

The economic stability of China is tied to its political stability, and when the markets eventually experience a recession, many analysts believe that political instability may ensue, and such an occurrence would unnecessarily erode the decades of political and economic progress.","China's rapid economic growth over the past few decades has been nothing short of remarkable. The country has transformed itself from a primarily agrarian society to the world's second-largest economy in just a few short decades. However, as with any economic growth, there are always challenges and risks that need to be addressed. In this essay, we will examine the reality of China's growth and explore the various factors that have contributed to its success.

One of the key factors driving China's growth has been its ability to attract foreign investment. In recent years, China has become one of the world's top destinations for foreign direct investment (FDI). This has been facilitated by the country's large and growing consumer market, as well as its relatively low labor costs. Many multinational corporations have set up operations in China in order to take advantage of these factors and to gain access to the country's rapidly growing consumer base.

Another factor driving China's growth has been its focus on technology and innovation. Over the past few years, China has invested heavily in research and development, with a particular emphasis on emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and 5G telecommunications. This has helped to create a highly skilled workforce and has attracted top talent from around the world.

However, China's rapid economic growth has also come with its share of challenges. One of the biggest issues facing the country is income inequality. Despite the country's overall economic success, there are still vast disparities in income and wealth between urban and rural areas. This has led to social unrest and has put pressure on the government to address these inequalities.

Another challenge facing China's growth is environmental sustainability. As the country's economy has grown, so too has its carbon footprint. China is now the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and its rapid industrialization has led to widespread pollution and environmental degradation. In recent years, the Chinese government has taken steps to address these issues, such as by investing in renewable energy and implementing stricter environmental regulations. However, there is still a long way to go to ensure that China's growth is sustainable in the long term.

In addition to these challenges, there are also geopolitical risks that need to be taken into account. China's growing economic and military power has led to tensions with other countries, particularly the United States. The ongoing trade war between the two countries has had significant economic impacts on both sides, and there are concerns that the tensions could escalate into a more serious conflict.

In conclusion, China's growth has been both remarkable and complex. While the country has made impressive strides in economic development and innovation, there are still significant challenges that need to be addressed. Income inequality, environmental sustainability, and geopolitical risks are just a few of the issues that China will need to navigate in order to ensure continued growth and success. As the world's second-largest economy, China's success is critical to the global economy, and it is in everyone's best interest to support the country's continued development and progress.",Argumentative,3
The Purpose of Schooling and the Role of School Leaders,"Very soon, the schools in Australia will enjoy the freedom of governing themselves in the sense that they will get the opportunity to make their own decisions. This will be in administration and the Australian federal Labor government heavily backs all this.

This came about after a lot of reassure from the National education agenda that pushed for the major reforms in schools. Each school will hold its own mandate to develop its own councils and even devolution of funds within the institution and come up with ways to harness declining performance in some students and boost the performance of others.

The issue of liberating the school administration and letting them govern themselves is still a topic of discussion and heavy debate. There is an argument that, as much as the government seems to have completely removed itself from the normal running of the schools it still has a major role to play in them.

For example, the government still has a role in making some initiatives and reforms for schools but the bureaucracy has been broken down to mask the entire issue. The government in most schools will still establish their own constraints and limits that the school should work on if they want continuous flow of funds from the government.

Schools do not really require involving themselves in the role of decision making, as they should ponder more the performance of the student rather than the competition among its industry and even materialization of fund in most cases. The parents also have a part to play in ensuring that the schools have an authentic touch.

The teachers in the Capita territory discovered the school-based model in 1967 in Australia in order to counter the bureaucratic model. This form of model has encouraged the schools to be more open and include the parents in the community in decision-making. The role can either be to offer expertise advice or even contribute ideas and help establish something in the school.

Involving the communities from around and helping form partnership will go a long way in helping communication of people. This will hence boost confidence among the students and the people of the community and eventually form the basis of trust, which is paramount in working towards certain goals and even coming up with comprehensive plans for the school’s effective management.

The structure and running of school’s differ and hence the strategic plans for the various schools are different because the students, teachers and the staff at large are not the same in all schools. The strategic plan should reflect the uniqueness and diversity of the students, staff and teachers, as it should look at the strengths and abilities of the stakeholders of this particular institution.

The Australian Federal Labour Government can make efforts to empower the schools only if the schools approve to adhere to a set agenda by the government and the government keeps the schools wrapped around their little finger by controlling their funds depending to how well they can adhere to the already set policies.

The standardised format set by the government may be unavoidable as we sometimes find that teachers cover a certain syllabus quickly and omit other necessary point that could be useful to the student all in the name of adhering to the rules and policies.","Schools are institutions that play a critical role in shaping the future of our society. The purpose of schooling is to provide students with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in life, both academically and professionally. The role of school leaders, including teachers, administrators, and staff, is to ensure that this purpose is achieved.

One of the primary purposes of schooling is to prepare students for the workforce. In today's economy, a college degree is often a prerequisite for many jobs, and high school graduates who do not pursue higher education often struggle to find meaningful employment. As such, schools must provide students with a rigorous academic curriculum that prepares them for college and careers.

Another important purpose of schooling is to promote social and emotional development. Schools are not only places of learning, but also communities where students can form relationships and learn important life skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. School leaders must create a safe and inclusive learning environment that fosters social and emotional development in addition to academic growth.

The role of school leaders in achieving these purposes cannot be overstated. Teachers, administrators, and staff must work together to create a cohesive educational program that meets the needs of all students. This includes designing curricula that align with state standards and providing students with the resources they need to succeed, such as textbooks, technology, and extracurricular activities.

In addition to these responsibilities, school leaders must also ensure that their schools are meeting the needs of all students, regardless of their background or circumstances. This includes addressing issues such as achievement gaps, cultural competency, and social justice. School leaders must be proactive in identifying and addressing these issues, both within their schools and in the wider community.

However, there are some who argue that the purpose of schooling should be solely focused on academic achievement, and that social and emotional development should be left to families and communities. They argue that schools should focus on traditional academic subjects such as math, science, and language arts, and that extracurricular activities should be limited to those that directly support academic achievement.

This perspective is short-sighted and ignores the important role that schools play in preparing students for life beyond the classroom. In order to succeed in the workforce, students need more than just academic knowledge; they also need to be able to communicate effectively, work collaboratively, and adapt to changing circumstances. These skills are developed through social and emotional learning, which is an essential component of schooling.

Furthermore, focusing solely on academic achievement can actually undermine students' ability to succeed. Research has shown that students who are stressed, anxious, or depressed are less likely to perform well academically. By promoting social and emotional development, schools can help students to manage stress and anxiety, and to develop the resilience they need to succeed academically and in life.

In conclusion, the purpose of schooling is to prepare students for college, careers, and life. This includes promoting academic achievement as well as social and emotional development. School leaders play a critical role in achieving these purposes by creating a cohesive educational program that meets the needs of all students, and by promoting a safe and inclusive learning environment. By recognizing the importance of social and emotional learning, schools can help students to succeed academically and in life, and can contribute to a more just and equitable society.

Motivation: Selfish Interests,"A number of psychologists have suggested that human beings are mainly motivated by selfish interests. Despite the overwhelming evidence that exists in support of this idea, the issue is still debatable due to the isolated cases of selflessness portrayed by a myriad of people around the world. This paper explores the theoretical argument that human beings are motivated by selfish interests in everything they do and seeks to refute this theory using realistic and practical reasons.

As discussed in the above paragraph, it has been suggested by a number of psychologists that human beings are motivated by selfish reasons in everything they do. Psychologists therefore argue that when one does a good thing, he does so for some selfish reason that may not be known.

An example that they normally give is the argument that if a person forgoes something good for them while caring for an ailing friend, he/she is mainly motivated by the fact that he/she will get a good name out of it. He/she could also be motivated by the fact that, by doing so, he/she will be building a strong relationship with his/her friend. Another example is that of a person who gives out his clothing to the poor.

Psychologists argue that such a person will give those clothes because they are no longer useful to him/her and by giving them away, the poor will have helped him/her in disposing them. All these theories make a lot of sense but there are a number of cases where a selfish motivation cannot be determined. This means that, as much as the theory is applicable. It is not applicable in all cases.

Despite the fact that the theory set up by psychologists explaining the motivation to doing good makes some sense, there are a number of cases that are not in conformance with the stipulations of the theory. This implies that the theory is wrong and thus it should not be used since it gives a generalized account of goodness in human beings.

An example of a case that does not conform to this theory is the case of people who help other people in need without wanting to be refunded anything and without wanting to be publicly known for their goodness. That is, the people who help and do not want to be known for the good they have done.

Psychologists may argue that such a person helps in order to get the feeling of being capable of helping somebody in need but the argument does not make sense. This is because such people are usually motivated by the situation; which in this case is the need of the person they give the help to. It can thus be argued that these people give selflessly since they are motivated by the need, and they give help without the desire to be known for their goodness.

In spite of the controversy surrounding the issue of selfish goodness that is allegedly characteristic of people, real life experiences show that there are people who qualify to be termed as exceptions to this theory.

These people are the selfless people discussed in the above paragraphs and thus it is unfair to say that they are good for selfish reasons. The theory, therefore, depends on the generalization of a common occurrence and thus it should be declared void. Research shows that the theory is not 100% right when applied to all people.","Motivation is defined as the driving force that compels a person to act in a certain way. This driving force can be influenced by a variety of factors, including personal values, beliefs, desires, and needs. One major factor that can impact motivation is selfish interests. In this essay, we will explore the role of selfish interests in motivation, how it can affect individuals, and ways to manage it.

Selfish interests can be defined as the pursuit of personal gain, often at the expense of others. This can manifest in many ways, such as seeking financial rewards, recognition, power, or status. While some individuals may argue that selfish interests are a negative force, others may argue that they can be a positive force for change and growth.

In terms of motivation, selfish interests can be a powerful driving force for individuals. For example, an entrepreneur may be motivated by the desire to build a successful business, which can bring financial rewards and recognition. A student may be motivated to study hard to achieve good grades, which can lead to future opportunities and success. In both cases, the pursuit of selfish interests can provide a strong sense of purpose and direction.

However, the pursuit of selfish interests can also have negative consequences. For instance, it can lead to unethical behavior, such as cheating or lying, in order to achieve one's goals. It can also lead to a lack of empathy and concern for others, which can damage personal relationships and create a negative reputation.

Therefore, it is important to manage selfish interests in a constructive manner. One way to do this is to align personal goals with the values and interests of others. This can help to create a win-win situation, where both parties benefit from the pursuit of shared goals. For example, an entrepreneur may create a business that not only generates profit but also benefits the community through job creation and social impact.

Another way to manage selfish interests is to adopt a growth mindset. This means embracing challenges and setbacks as opportunities for learning and improvement. By focusing on personal growth rather than personal gain, individuals can maintain a sense of purpose and motivation while also developing a greater sense of empathy and concern for others.

In addition, it is important to cultivate self-awareness and reflection. This involves being honest with oneself about personal motivations and the impact they have on others. By reflecting on one's own behavior and its consequences, individuals can develop a greater sense of accountability and responsibility.

In conclusion, selfish interests can be a powerful motivator for individuals, but it can also have negative consequences. By aligning personal goals with the values and interests of others, adopting a growth mindset, and cultivating self-awareness and reflection, individuals can manage their selfish interests in a constructive manner. By doing so, they can achieve their goals while also contributing to the well-being of others.",Argumentative,
Mass Media Representation of Men and Women,"The contemporary society is made up of different kinds of people shaped by the ideas represented in the media and the popular culture.

Generally, the ideal man is portrayed according to the views of the media and in most cases; many individuals do everything possible to resemble the people represented in the media.

Being a black American in a white society has its difficulties as many stereotypes are associated with this particular race. All these stereotypes and differences are majorly influenced by the ideas represented in the media.

This is further exacerbated by the position the media plays as an influential agent of socialization that has the capacity to influence even the other agents of socialization such as peers, the family and the family or school institutions.

JHally in his documentary “Desire, sex and power in music videos”, talks about women and men who are represented in an overly exaggerated manner as opposed to a real representation.

He describes the women represented in music videos as a fantasy of the adolescents. The ideal woman is defined as one who is slim and light skinned in complexion, with blonde hair being overly exaggerated as a mark of beauty.

The men portrayed in the music videos are also associated with certain features, which include the masculinity aspect.

A real man is supposed to be masculine and thus, the girls who get to watch such kind of men may end up losing partners in their lives because they always look for the ideal man as represented in music videos and other visual media.

Relationships are represented in a stereotypical manner. For instance, in Katz video “Tough Guise”, he analyzes violence, media and crisis in masculinity.

In this video, masculinity is analyzed in terms of relationships that exist between the male and other males and the males and females. In both videos, the aspects of racism, classism and heterosexism are represented.

People relate with each other in terms of race and class. Thus, the blacks associate with fellow blacks and the whites too.

Heterosexism is an aspect that is not strange according to the whites and according to the “Tough Guise” video male-male relationships are part of their relationships in their society.

However, these two videos are against the stereotypes associated with human beings as they urge people to watch all videos with a critical eye. The directors of these videos say that, the media and popular culture can influence our thinking and lifestyle in a great way albeit all the views they represent are not true.

The ideas and views in these videos are a mere representation of the adolescents’ fantasies. These representations relate to what I am today since, have always thought that the media represents the perfect man.

Popular culture has had an effect on me, as I have lived to believe that women who are viewed as pretty are petite and light skinned. On the other hand, a man should be masculine for him to qualify as a real man.

This exercise has changed my way of thinking as I have learnt that; the men, women and everything that the media represents are all purposely meant to attract an audience.

The advertisements, music, and films represent people who are a creation of fiction and not reality. Their representation in the media is more influenced by the need to paint a certain mental picture that only represents what should be ideal as opposed to what should be a reality.","Mass media has a significant impact on how people view the world around them, including how they perceive gender roles and stereotypes. The representation of men and women in media has been a topic of concern for many years, as it can have a significant impact on society's attitudes and beliefs about gender.

Historically, men have been represented in media as powerful, strong, and dominant figures. They are often portrayed as the breadwinners and decision-makers of their households, while women are relegated to secondary roles as homemakers and caregivers. This type of representation can perpetuate gender stereotypes and lead to unequal treatment of men and women in society.

Women, on the other hand, have traditionally been portrayed as sexual objects or submissive characters in media. They are often depicted as passive and in need of protection from male characters. These representations can have negative effects on women's self-esteem and can contribute to gender-based violence and discrimination.

However, in recent years, there has been a push for more positive and diverse representations of men and women in media. Many media outlets have started to feature strong female characters and challenge traditional gender roles. This shift has been welcomed by many, as it can help to break down stereotypes and promote gender equality.

One area where positive representation of women has been particularly important is in the entertainment industry. In the past, female characters in movies and television shows were often portrayed as one-dimensional stereotypes, such as the ""damsel in distress"" or the ""sexy sidekick"". However, in recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of female-led productions and strong female characters. For example, the success of shows like ""Game of Thrones"" and ""The Handmaid's Tale"" has demonstrated that audiences are hungry for complex and powerful female characters.

Similarly, men have also benefited from more diverse and positive representations in media. The traditional portrayal of men as stoic and unemotional has been challenged, and more emphasis has been placed on male vulnerability and emotional depth. This shift can help to break down harmful gender stereotypes and promote healthier attitudes towards masculinity.

However, despite these positive changes, there is still much work to be done. Women, in particular, continue to be underrepresented in media and face significant barriers to entry in many industries. Additionally, harmful gender stereotypes and representations continue to persist in some areas of media, perpetuating negative attitudes towards women and contributing to gender-based violence and discrimination.

In conclusion, the representation of men and women in mass media has a significant impact on society's attitudes and beliefs about gender. While there have been positive changes in recent years, harmful gender stereotypes and representations continue to persist in some areas of media. It is important to continue pushing for more diverse and positive representations of men and women in order to promote gender equality and break down harmful gender stereotypes.",Argumentative,
Effects of Migration on Women,"Since time memorial, people from all walks of life migrate to countries in search for better life opportunities. Migrations occur as a result of wars, natural disasters or even in search for better job opportunities. According to the 2011 immigration statistics, 29,436 male and 26,948 female immigrants relocated to the US. Over the years, the difference between male and female migrants reduced drastically as a result of women joining other family members who migrated earlier.

Most women migrate due to circumstances than choice unlike men who migrate in search of job opportunities. Women join their husbands during migration to avoid being left alone. The low number of women migrating is as a result of the physical and emotional attachment they have with their home countries. This reluctance is as a result of cultural believes which requires women to stay at home and take care of the family. In the end, women have a stronger bond or attachment to their homes and families than men.
In many societies, age of a person determines whether one is able to migrate. The young and energetic women migrate more than the aged. Most men migrate irrespective of their ages since they are able to withstand long journeys during migration. Young women migrate to escape poverty and cultural practices which infringe on their rights.
Economically, migrating women are able to get household jobs easier than their male counterparts since they are low paying jobs. This makes women an easy target for exploitation, abuse and discrimination. In most cases, female migrants earn less than their male counterparts.
On the brighter side, women tend to remit more money back home to support their families compared to men. These jobs overburden women with a lot of responsibilities to supplement what the husband brings at the end of the day. In the end, women migrants work for longer hours with little or no time to rest.
In most cases, the rights and freedom of women migrants are infringed during transit or in the destination countries. The most common form of violation includes sexual and physical abuse. In some cases, people kidnap women to give cheap labor in the destination countries.
The perpetrators know that they can get away with their crime since the victims cannot accuse them due to fear of arrest and deportation. They sometimes work under harsh conditions which affect them emotionally and physically. The rights of men are rarely violated since they are able to defend themselves when attacked.
In war prone areas, women and children are the ones who bear most of the brunt from the conflict. Since they have no option, they have to walk long distances in search for safe haven. They then take the role of father which poses a greater challenge especially when raising the children.
Migration can also happen for good reasons like family reunion. Women and children migrate to reunite with their male family members. Reunion offers a chance for the women to enjoy better lifestyles especially in countries like the US where people respect the rights and freedom of women. They also get more conducive environment away from oppression and cultural practices.
From the discussion above, one concludes that the benefits women migrants enjoy are far less than what they get. As a result, women lose more during migration than they gain.
","Migration is a complex and multi-dimensional phenomenon that has significant impacts on individuals, families, and societies. Women, in particular, experience unique challenges and opportunities during the migration process. The effects of migration on women can be both positive and negative, depending on a variety of factors such as the reasons for migration, the destination country, and the social and economic status of women.

One of the positive effects of migration on women is the potential for increased economic opportunities. Migration can provide women with access to better-paying jobs and improved living conditions, particularly if they migrate from low-income or impoverished areas. Many women migrate for work in industries such as domestic work, healthcare, and education, which can provide opportunities for career advancement and financial stability. This economic empowerment can also have a positive impact on their families and communities, as they may be able to provide financial support and contribute to the local economy.

However, migration can also have negative effects on women's physical and mental health. Women who migrate may face increased risks of violence and abuse, particularly if they are undocumented or working in informal sectors. These risks can be exacerbated if they are living in poverty or have limited access to healthcare and social services. Additionally, women who migrate may experience isolation and loneliness, particularly if they are separated from their families and support networks.

Another significant effect of migration on women is the impact on family dynamics. Women who migrate may be separated from their families for extended periods of time, which can have significant effects on their emotional well-being and relationships with their children and partners. Children may be left behind in their home countries, or women may be forced to navigate the challenges of raising children alone in a new and unfamiliar environment. Additionally, the expectations and responsibilities of women within their families and communities may shift as a result of migration, leading to changes in gender roles and dynamics.

Migration can also have significant impacts on women's cultural and social identities. Women may be forced to navigate new cultural norms and expectations in the destination country, which can be challenging and disorienting. They may also face discrimination and prejudice based on their gender, race, or ethnicity, which can lead to feelings of exclusion and marginalization. Conversely, some women may experience a sense of empowerment and liberation through migration, particularly if they come from cultures or societies where women have limited opportunities and freedoms.

In order to mitigate the negative effects of migration on women, it is important to address the systemic and structural factors that contribute to their vulnerability. Governments and policymakers should prioritize the protection of women's rights and access to healthcare, education, and social services. Additionally, efforts should be made to address the root causes of migration, such as poverty, political instability, and climate change.

In conclusion, the effects of migration on women are complex and multifaceted, with both positive and negative impacts. Women who migrate may experience increased economic opportunities and cultural enrichment, but also face significant challenges and risks to their physical and emotional well-being. It is essential that policymakers and society as a whole prioritize the needs and rights of migrant women, and work to create a more equitable and supportive environment for all.

To Believe or Not to Believe with Insufficient Evidence,"William Clifford strongly held on his epistemological dictum that people should believe without systematic evidences. His idealism clung on the fear or error through questioning on evidences. He committed his pragmatist view on empiricist basis of verification. I do not believe in this perception whatsoever. I don’t want to believe on phenomenon or ideas without solid evidences. Clifford’s biased imperialism principles are greatly erroneous.

Our beliefs are efficacious at levels beyond what is personal. They affect the social integration among people. For this reason, it makes less sense to believe things with regard to fear of making an error. We cannot therefore believe without sufficient evidences as Clifford postulates.

This is especially so when it comes to such things where empirical data can be used as evidences. However, in cases where such evidence is exempted, it becomes very difficult to believe. This should be a personal choice and no one should be forced in whatever means to take any line of thought. Every person should be given the opportunity to choose whether to believe or not to.

Religious and metaphysical beliefs on the other hand should be respected but as James believes they should not be believed fallaciously especially when they affect the people rationally or irrationally. They should however be analyzed for the greater good of the people. No believe therefore should be accepted on mere faith.

Scientific theories should be hypothesized and scientific methods should be incorporated to ensure that we have a ground to believe in these theories. Evidentialism for instance led to scientists like Lamarck to postulate fallacious hypothesis about evolution. He said that acquired characteristics were inheritable and therefore could be passed from one generation to another. This was however disapproved through evidenced approaches and hypothesis.

It therefore leads to a general conclusion that the fear of error should not lead individual to believe in non-evidenced approaches especially in social and natural sciences (William 524). This phenomenon puts across the numerous errors that are made upon believes with sufficient evidence. The effects in our decisions are much more rampant and could have far reaching effects in our social lives.

For this reason, it becomes greatly important to re-evaluate circumstances and seeking of empirical evidences before we can solidly conclude some issues. I strongly disagree with Clifford and I believe that it is quite vulnerable to make an error from assumptions and insufficiently evidenced beliefs than in properly researched and evidenced cases.

People should understand that evidentialism leads them into constrictive skepticism and irrational subjectivism. Philosophy should therefore cut in and allow people to understand decision making especially in such dogmas that cuts across epistemology, philosophy of religion and philosophy of science.

It should also allow us to think rationally and be in a position to classify genuine believes and those that try to avoid error. Clifford’s point of view is erroneous and reinforced by fear and it should therefore not form any basis of decision making in individuals.

As James observed, life changing ideologies based on metaphysical beliefs and religion should be purely on free will. Clifford’s perceptions that scientific probabilities as mere assumptions was wrong as scientific methods with substantiated empirical data are applied to come up with the probabilities.","To believe or not to believe? That is the question many of us have faced at some point in our lives. We may be presented with information that seems too good to be true, or too alarming to ignore. In these situations, it can be difficult to know what to believe, especially when there is insufficient evidence to support a claim. However, it is important to approach these situations with a critical mind and resist the temptation to believe everything we hear.

Believing in something without sufficient evidence is often referred to as ""faith,"" but faith alone is not enough to validate a claim. It is important to evaluate the evidence and consider alternative explanations before coming to a conclusion. This is especially true when it comes to scientific claims, which require rigorous testing and peer review before they can be accepted as fact.

Unfortunately, many people are willing to believe in pseudoscientific claims that have not been properly tested or verified. These claims can range from the harmless, such as the belief in lucky charms or horoscopes, to the dangerous, such as the rejection of proven medical treatments in favor of unproven alternative therapies. In both cases, the lack of evidence should be a red flag that these claims are not based in reality.

The danger of believing in something without sufficient evidence is that it can lead to harmful consequences. For example, some people may refuse to vaccinate their children based on the belief that vaccines are linked to autism, despite the overwhelming scientific evidence to the contrary. This not only puts their own children at risk, but also undermines the effectiveness of herd immunity, which protects vulnerable members of society who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons.

Similarly, the belief in conspiracy theories can lead people to distrust established institutions and reject scientific evidence. This can have serious consequences when it comes to issues like climate change or the COVID-19 pandemic, where accepting the science is crucial for effective policy decisions.

It is important to note that not all claims require the same level of evidence. For example, it may be reasonable to believe in the existence of extraterrestrial life, even though there is currently no definitive evidence to support this claim. However, even in these cases, it is important to maintain a healthy skepticism and not jump to conclusions based on insufficient evidence.

The key to avoiding the pitfalls of believing in something without sufficient evidence is to approach all claims with a critical mind. This means evaluating the evidence, considering alternative explanations, and being willing to revise our beliefs in light of new evidence. It also means being willing to admit when we are wrong and adjust our beliefs accordingly.

In conclusion, believing in something without sufficient evidence is a dangerous proposition that can lead to harmful consequences. It is important to approach all claims with a critical mind and resist the temptation to believe everything we hear. While faith can be a powerful motivator, it should never be a substitute for evidence-based reasoning. Only by staying grounded in reality can we hope to make informed decisions that benefit ourselves and society as a whole.",Persuasive,
Why Foreign Education is worth the Price,"Many students across the world, especially those from developing and emerging economies, continue to seek for educational opportunities in the developed world. International education is expensive by any standards, but cost factors alone have failed to dissuade students from seeking education in foreign countries. This brief essay purposes to demonstrate the reasons why foreign education is worth the price.

The first reason deals with the quality of education provided in home countries. Many of the college certificates offered in home countries, especially in the developing world, are not recognized in international job markets.

Students undergoing these systems of education are constricted in their opportunities for career choices due to the low quality of education, not mentioning that they are unable to secure employment outside their home countries because the certificates received from their respective home colleges cannot be recognized elsewhere.

However, most foreign-based educational institutions are recognized for offering quality education and students who have passed through these systems can be assured of getting employment anywhere across the world.

The second reason deals with the exposure students get upon travelling abroad to enroll into the foreign-based educational institutions. It is often said that students need to be exposed to a whole range of variables for them to succeed in their career life, with two of the most important variables being interpersonal socialization and cultural socialization.

International education guarantees that students develop their socialization capacities in the two fronts not only because of exposure to a diverse cultural set up in the university, but also due to constant engagement with other students from all over the world. This kind of exposure is critical in developing a future professional in any career field.

The third reason deals with scarcity of educational institutions in home countries. There exist scenarios where students have performed exemplarily well in their high school examinations only for them to be locked out of the local universities due to lack of places to accommodate them.

In such situations, it is always plausible to look elsewhere to secure quality institutions where these students will progress their education for future career endeavors. It may appear costly to enroll abroad for lack of places at the local universities, but the education received abroad will certainly pay dividends in the future.

The last reason, which is intrinsically tied to the third, deals with pursuing an educational direction that is of core interest to the student rather than going to the university for the sake of getting post-secondary education and certification.

Due to constrained resources in many home countries, especially in the developing world, qualified students are forced to undertake courses they didn’t choose in the first instance. The most revered courses, such as engineering, medicine and aviation, are considered a preserve of the very few who had managed to perform exemplarily well in their high school examinations.

Many students who also did very well but perhaps performed poorly in a single subject are forced to take courses they didn’t choose and, therefore, not of interest to their career path. In such circumstances, it is always better to look elsewhere so that you’re able to pursue a course that is not only of interest to you, but will also assist you to pursue future career opportunities in the field of your choice.","In today's globalized world, obtaining an education from a foreign institution has become a popular choice for many students. While this option may come with a higher price tag, the benefits of receiving an education abroad make it a worthwhile investment. In this essay, I will argue that foreign education is worth the price due to the opportunities it provides for personal and professional growth, enhanced cultural understanding, and increased career prospects.

Firstly, a foreign education offers opportunities for personal and professional growth that may not be available in one's home country. Studying abroad allows individuals to gain independence, adapt to new surroundings, and develop a global perspective. These experiences can contribute to personal growth by challenging one's comfort zone and helping them to become more self-aware. Additionally, the cultural and social differences encountered while studying abroad can lead to a more well-rounded and culturally aware individual, which is highly valued by employers in today's globalized job market.

Secondly, foreign education fosters a deeper understanding and appreciation for different cultures. By immersing oneself in a different culture, students can learn about new customs, beliefs, and values, which can broaden their perspective and make them more tolerant and accepting of cultural differences. This exposure can also contribute to a greater understanding of global issues and help individuals to become more informed global citizens.

Finally, foreign education can increase career prospects and earning potential. Graduates with international experience are highly sought after by employers due to their adaptability, language skills, and cultural awareness. In addition, foreign education can lead to valuable international connections and networking opportunities, which can open doors to global job opportunities that may not be available in one's home country. The increased earning potential that comes with these opportunities can help to offset the higher cost of a foreign education.

While some may argue that the cost of a foreign education is too high, it is important to consider the long-term benefits that come with it. The investment in a foreign education is not just about the immediate return on investment, but also about the personal and professional growth that can be achieved through the experience.

It is also important to note that financial aid and scholarships are often available to help offset the cost of a foreign education. These opportunities are often merit-based and can provide significant financial support to qualified students. Additionally, some countries offer lower tuition fees and living costs, making a foreign education a more affordable option.

In conclusion, the benefits of a foreign education far outweigh the higher price tag. The opportunities for personal and professional growth, enhanced cultural understanding, and increased career prospects make it a worthwhile investment. While it may require a larger financial commitment, the long-term benefits are invaluable and can lead to a fulfilling and successful career in today's globalized world.",Persuasive,
Blanchard and Fiedler Leadership Models,"As opposed to Taylorists who opined that there was a single way of proper management and leadership for that matter, Fred Fiedler stated that the efficacy of one as a leader was solely dependant upon situational contingency. Situational contingency according to him was broken down as to relate to the style of leadership and the favorableness of various situations.

This theory differs from the situational model which was first set out as the life cycle theory of leadership. In the latter theory, Ken Blanchard is of the opinion that an interaction between the maturity of the leader and the requirements of a task are important in establishing a superb leadership style.
These two theories are similar in the sense that they both suggest that there is no specific one leadership style that is to be universally accepted as “the one.” Rather different situations will call for managers to operate in different ways. The two theories both negate the traits of the leaders, something that was previously theories majorly focused upon.
Forsyth expresses that Fiedler’s theory introduces situational control; something that is also present in the Blanchard’s Situational theory. However the latter incorporates directing, coaching, supporting and delegating as the key roles that leaders should utilize to influence their followers.
DuBrin states that in Fiedler’s model, he introduces the least preferred co worker scale that is used to identify the task orientation level s and friendliness of the leader. Basically, he categorizes leaders as being task oriented or people oriented. Bipolar scales of between 1 and 8 are utilized by Fiedler. In this, leaders are asked about the workers they have worked with and rank them in terms of cooperation accorded, friendliness and supportive levels among other traits. Results will establish whether a leader is people oriented or task oriented.
Blanchard on the other hand focuses on how well a leader tells, sells, participates and delegates tasks. The higher the flexibility expressed in these tasks, the better the leader. Maturity levels are also relevant where Ken gives them a scale of M1 to M4. At M1 specific skills are absent and the willingness to work. As someone moves to M4, experience, skill and comfort at work will keeps increasing more.
An evaluation of Waldinc International shows that human relations leadership model is more applicable. This is because the organization being a management consultancy firm, more emphasis is given to serving our clients the best way we can be and be sensitive to their specific needs. Our staff therefore needs to be comfortable and in the correct mind state at all times so that service to our clients will be best. Human relations model is the best to achieve this.
As an organization we need to continually improve and this will call for a learning organization so that feedback from our employees will be high. We need to create an environment of innovation, creativity and free flow of information and so we consider that the human relations model of Fiedler would work best for our firm to achieve these.
Further for easier diagnosis of problem areas in our organization, we consider that by use of this style, the employees would be able to open up easily to us so that we can exchange more information and keep improving in our provision of management consultancy services.
","Leadership is a complex and multifaceted concept, and there are numerous models and theories that attempt to explain it. Two prominent models are Blanchard's situational leadership model and Fiedler's contingency model of leadership effectiveness. Both of these models offer unique perspectives on what it takes to be an effective leader, and understanding their differences and similarities can help individuals develop their own leadership skills.

Blanchard's situational leadership model is based on the idea that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to leadership. Instead, effective leaders must be able to adapt their leadership style to the situation at hand. The model is based on two key elements: the leadership style and the developmental level of the followers. The four leadership styles identified by Blanchard are directing, coaching, supporting, and delegating, and each one is best suited for a particular developmental level of the followers.

In contrast, Fiedler's contingency model of leadership effectiveness argues that there is no one best leadership style. Instead, the effectiveness of a leader depends on two key factors: the leader's style and the favorableness of the situation. The model identifies three key situational factors that influence leadership effectiveness: leader-member relations, task structure, and position power. Depending on the combination of these factors, Fiedler's model proposes that leaders will be either task-oriented or relationship-oriented.

Both models have their strengths and weaknesses. Blanchard's situational leadership model is highly adaptable and takes into account the unique needs and abilities of followers, making it a useful tool for leaders in a variety of settings. However, it can be difficult to apply in practice, as accurately assessing the developmental level of followers can be challenging.

On the other hand, Fiedler's contingency model is based on a more concrete set of factors, making it easier to apply in practice. It also recognizes the importance of situational factors in determining leadership effectiveness, which can be crucial in fast-paced or constantly changing environments. However, it does not take into account the individual needs or abilities of followers, and can be less effective in situations where relationships are key to success.

In terms of persuasion, both models can be used to convince individuals of the importance of effective leadership. Blanchard's situational leadership model emphasizes the need for leaders to be adaptable and responsive to the needs of their followers, which can be persuasive in convincing individuals of the value of leadership development. Fiedler's contingency model, on the other hand, emphasizes the importance of situational factors in determining leadership effectiveness, which can be persuasive in convincing individuals of the need for leaders to be aware of and adapt to their environment.

Ultimately, both models offer valuable insights into the complex nature of leadership. By understanding the differences and similarities between the two models, individuals can gain a deeper understanding of what it takes to be an effective leader in a variety of settings. Whether focusing on the individual needs of followers or the situational factors that influence leadership effectiveness, the lessons learned from these models can be applied in a wide range of contexts, making them valuable tools for anyone looking to improve their leadership skills.",Expository,
How to Develop Self Confidence,"Self-confidence is ones status of being assured and having a strong belief in himself and his abilities. A person who is self-confident does not struggle too much to make decisions. This essay paper focuses on the three main steps of developing self-confidence. They include; initial preparation, setting out for the process, and accelerating towards success. The final success is determined by both self-efficacy and esteem.

The first step is preparing for the journey. This is the journey to self-confidence that may be long or short depending on the person in question. It’s good for a person to identify first where he is, and his destination. The person should focus on what he has already achieved, at least ten of his best achievements. These should be written somewhere for references.

While still preparing for the journey, it’s good to think about your strengths. This part should include weaknesses, opportunities and threats, but put emphasis on strengths. The other important aspect is managing ones mind by defeating inner talks that can deter the confidence. The final part of preparing for the journey is, committing yourself to succeed.

The second step is setting out to begin the journey. The right way should be towards the set goals. At this stage one should gather all the knowledge he or she requires so as to succeed. This involves looking for the required skills and acquiring them to be fully equipped. Let the basics be the starting point of the whole process, thus one should not emphasis on perfection but do simple things successfully.

The main objective here would be to set small goals, achieving them successfully, and rejoicing for the achievements. There is no need of setting big challenging goals at this point. While still setting up for the journey, one should keep his or her mind on the positive side. This can be achieved through rejoicing for the attained success. On the other hand, ones mind should also have some techniques of handling failure. Mistakes are inevitable especially when one is trying something for the first time.

The third and the final step is accelerating towards success. At this stage one start feeling some self-confidence developing. There will be several achieved small goals in step 2 to be celebrated in this stage. One feels there is a room for making bigger goals with tougher challenges. Here the person feels more committed than before. At this point some people tend to be over confident due to over stretching themselves.

This should not be the case, as one should stay grounded. Its advisable now for one to evaluate himself or her to see how far is the development. While doing self-evaluation, one finds it simple to identify some unique strategies for developing self-confidence. Stretching bit by bit without overdoing it will lead to a top level of self-confidence.

In conclusion, each step of the three main steps is connected to the other. The first step of preparing for the journey is setting the base for the next step. The crucial aspects set in step two are the ones being celebrated in step three making the process a success.","Self-confidence is an essential trait that enables us to live life to the fullest. It is a state of mind that empowers us to believe in ourselves, take risks, and face challenges with a positive attitude. The good news is that self-confidence can be developed with some effort and practice. In this essay, we will discuss some strategies that can help us build self-confidence.

The first step towards building self-confidence is to identify our strengths and weaknesses. We all have certain areas where we excel and others where we struggle. By acknowledging our strengths, we can build upon them, while by addressing our weaknesses, we can work towards improving them. This can be done by setting realistic goals and working towards achieving them one step at a time. It is important to celebrate small successes along the way to keep ourselves motivated and on track.

Another key factor in building self-confidence is to learn to appreciate ourselves. We need to remind ourselves of our worth and value as individuals. This can be done by focusing on our positive qualities and achievements, and not dwelling on our shortcomings. It is also helpful to surround ourselves with positive and supportive people who uplift and encourage us.

Physical appearance can also play a role in how confident we feel. Taking care of our appearance can help us feel better about ourselves. This can be as simple as maintaining good hygiene, dressing in clothes that make us feel comfortable and confident, and taking care of our health through exercise and a healthy diet.

Self-confidence can also be developed by stepping out of our comfort zones and taking on new challenges. This could be something as small as trying a new hobby or as big as pursuing a new career. The important thing is to take action and not let fear hold us back. It is normal to feel anxious or nervous when trying something new, but with practice, we can learn to overcome these feelings and build our self-confidence.

Another helpful strategy is to practice positive self-talk. This involves replacing negative self-talk with positive affirmations. For example, instead of saying ""I can't do this,"" we can say ""I can do this, and I will do my best."" Positive self-talk can help us reframe our thoughts and develop a more optimistic outlook.

Finally, it is important to remember that building self-confidence is a gradual process that takes time and effort. It is normal to experience setbacks and challenges along the way. However, by persevering and practicing these strategies, we can develop a more positive self-image and become more confident in ourselves and our abilities.

In conclusion, self-confidence is a vital component of a fulfilling life. By identifying our strengths and weaknesses, learning to appreciate ourselves, taking on new challenges, practicing positive self-talk, and surrounding ourselves with supportive people, we can develop our self-confidence. It is important to remember that building self-confidence is a process that takes time and effort, but with practice and perseverance, it is achievable.",Expository,
Does Social Class Make a Difference?,"Social class is an integral parameter especially in regard to access to important resources as well as various opportunities in life. People who are presumably from high social class seem to control most resources in our society today. Hence, they determine what people from lower social classes should get. I strongly believe that those who belong in higher social class control myriad means of both basic and secondary production which is heavily relied upon by those in lower social class.

In most cases, individuals of high social class tend to have no barrier in social mobility in comparison to their counterparts in lower social ladder. Therefore, it is pertinent to note that social mobility of an individual is highly likely to be influenced by social status in society. For instance, it takes spans of generations for one to change his or her social class particularly with people of disadvantaged background, wealthy parents tend to have wealthy children’s as poor parent continues to have poor children.

This trend continues for indefinitely long period of time.
Social class will also affect the way individuals perceive things within their environment. Different social classes affect people’s perception. For instance, people from high social class will probably perceive those who are suffering as poor people since they feel poverty is connected with suffering.

A person from low social class may perceive suffering to be caused by emotional and physical problems which are not connected with poverty. Hence, different perceptions arise depending on individual’s social class owing to the fact that different problems are experienced by people from different social classes which later influences their attitude and perception towards life.

Social class diversity also creates differences on people relate with each other. Different component of social class determines relationship of individuals from different social classes. For instance, I am of the view that class diversity at workplace has always influenced the way promotions and demotions are determined in organizations.

Different diversions of social classes determines the way top management relates to individuals who are at the lower social ladder and it is what determines placement in organizations. When there is absence of management strategies to evaluate and monitor performances of different social classes, majority of the low class will be perceived different in organizations. Your assigned social class determines your role and position in society which on the overall makes a difference in your achievement.

I am of the opinion that social class affects an individual’s work and determines his role in the religion. Most individuals choose religions and work depending on their social status, certain works are meant for people of certain social class. In our everyday life, jobs like cleaning and gardening may be meant for people of low social class as some executive jobs like management positions are meant for people of high social class.

This has been enhanced by several factors such as discrimination and perception that people have on different types of jobs. The association of different social classes to certain types of employment depending on technical knowledge has enhanced the application of social class in determining the nature of work place.

It is only religion which tends to unite both social classes irrespective of one’s county of origin. Individuals from both classes share religion with different denominations regardless of one’s social class.","Does social class make a difference? This is a question that has been debated for decades, if not centuries. The answer is not a simple one, as there are many factors that influence a person’s social class and many ways in which it can affect their life.

Social class refers to a person’s position in society based on factors such as income, education, and occupation. It can have a significant impact on a person’s health, education, and overall well-being. Research has shown that those in lower social classes are more likely to experience poor health outcomes, lower educational achievement, and higher rates of poverty.

One way in which social class can make a difference is in terms of health outcomes. People in lower social classes are more likely to experience a range of health problems, from chronic illnesses to mental health issues. This may be due to factors such as limited access to healthcare, poor nutrition, and exposure to environmental toxins. In addition, people in lower social classes are more likely to engage in behaviors that can lead to poor health outcomes, such as smoking, alcohol use, and lack of exercise.

Education is another area in which social class can make a difference. Those in higher social classes are more likely to have access to quality education and to go on to pursue higher degrees. This can lead to better job prospects and higher income levels. On the other hand, people in lower social classes may have limited access to quality education and may be forced to drop out of school to support themselves and their families. This can limit their job prospects and lead to a cycle of poverty.

Finally, social class can also affect a person’s overall well-being. Those in lower social classes are more likely to experience stress and anxiety due to financial and other pressures. They may also feel stigmatized and marginalized by society, leading to a sense of isolation and loneliness.

Despite the many ways in which social class can impact a person’s life, it is important to note that it is not a fixed or immutable characteristic. While it can be difficult to move up the social ladder, it is not impossible. Education is one way in which people can improve their social class and increase their opportunities for success. By pursuing higher education and gaining new skills and knowledge, individuals can increase their earning potential and improve their quality of life.

In addition, social programs and policies can also help to level the playing field and reduce the impact of social class on people’s lives. Programs that provide access to healthcare, education, and other basic needs can help to alleviate some of the burdens faced by those in lower social classes. In addition, policies that promote equality and reduce income inequality can help to create a more just and equitable society.

In conclusion, social class does make a difference in people’s lives. It can impact their health, education, and overall well-being. However, it is important to recognize that social class is not a fixed characteristic and that individuals and society as a whole can take steps to reduce its impact. By investing in education and social programs and promoting policies that reduce income inequality, we can work towards a more just and equitable society where everyone has the opportunity to succeed.",Persuasive,
White Wines vs. Red Wines,"Usually people who love wine prefer white or red. Although both of them are produced by grape, there are several differences between those two noble beverages. According to a number of researchers, red wine contains elements good for heart; therefore, red wine is more helpful for health due to its capability to prevent heart diseases and protect arteries from damage.

Comparing the features of white and red wines, we can notice that both of them have a number of good qualities which make them attractive to people. Thus, white wine has crisp, fruity flavor and aroma, while red one has a richer flavor. Obviously, variety of colors is caused by the use of different grapes. Red wine is made from black and dark red grapes. Due to the different raw materials, and especially components from the skin of grapes, white and red wines differ in tannins that cause the color and flavor of red wines.

Health benefits of red wines are the major argument of those people who like red more than white. Although red wine helps preventing heart diseases and protecting arteries due to its antioxidants, white wine contains fewer calories. However, their level can vary according to the concrete wine. French people have less level of heart diseases due to their habit of drinking a glass of red wine every day. The strongest antioxidants contained in red wine such as reservatrol make it healthier than white one.

Reservatrol prevents the damage of blood vessels and the blood clots that are very dangerous for live. Taking into account the caloric content, we can say that both types have almost the same per cent. However, mostly, white wine contains fewer ratios of calories than red wine. Nevertheless, this characteristic does not provide the serious arguments in support of white wine. Besides, white wine is more acidic and more dangerous for the teeth.

In culinary, red wine is more popular than white one. There are docents of recipes of cooking with red wine. As it had been mentioned before, red wine has stronger flavor and aroma. As cooks want to make their dish more intensive and to enhance its taste, aroma and color, they usually use red wine as a marinade, cooking liquid or additional ingredient to a finished dish.

For instance, this type of wine tastes good with meat, while white is used with fish. Red wine paints a sauce to the purple color and brings the special taste. However, it is difficult to state upon one assertion due to the different tastes of people and hundreds of methods and recopies. Thereby, a good cook can use any kind of wine, trying to create a new taste of the dishes.

White and red wines are very different due to the materials of production. Red wine is healthier and helps preventing heart diseases and protecting arteries from damage. Due to the intensive color and aroma, red wine is more popular in culinary. However, many people prefer white wine because of its taste.

The level of calories in the both types is almost the same. In any situation, it is important to remember that both red and white wines have the same effect on the human body and mind. Therefore, in is necessary to control the use of wine, limiting it to one glass per day.","When it comes to wine, there are countless options to choose from. One of the most significant distinctions among wines is between red and white wines. While some wine drinkers prefer one over the other, others enjoy both varieties for different occasions and pairings. In this essay, we will compare and contrast the characteristics of white wines and red wines, including their flavor profiles, food pairings, and health benefits.

One of the most obvious differences between white wines and red wines is their color. White wines are produced from grapes with light-colored skins and flesh, while red wines are made from grapes with darker skins and flesh. As a result, white wines tend to have a lighter and crisper taste than red wines, with flavors that may include citrus, green apple, and pear. On the other hand, red wines are generally fuller-bodied with flavors that can range from fruity and floral to earthy and spicy, depending on the grape variety and winemaking process.

The choice between white and red wines can also depend on the type of food being served. White wines are typically paired with lighter dishes such as seafood, chicken, and salads, as well as cheese and crackers. White wines are also a great choice for outdoor events, picnics, and brunches. In contrast, red wines are generally paired with heartier dishes such as beef, lamb, and pasta with red sauce. Red wines are also often paired with aged cheeses and chocolate desserts. Red wines are a popular choice for dinner parties and formal events.

Both red and white wines have been associated with health benefits, although the benefits may vary depending on the type of wine and the individual. Red wines are often touted for their high levels of resveratrol, a polyphenol that is believed to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Some studies have suggested that moderate red wine consumption may lower the risk of heart disease, stroke, and certain types of cancer. White wines, on the other hand, are lower in calories and may be a better choice for those watching their weight. Additionally, white wines may contain high levels of antioxidants and may help to improve cognitive function and reduce the risk of certain types of cancer.

In conclusion, white wines and red wines each have their own unique characteristics that make them a popular choice among wine drinkers. White wines tend to be lighter and crisper with citrus and green apple flavors, while red wines are fuller-bodied with fruity and earthy flavors. White wines are typically paired with lighter dishes and are often chosen for outdoor events, while red wines are paired with heartier dishes and are popular for dinner parties and formal events. Both types of wines may offer health benefits, although the benefits may vary depending on the individual and the type of wine. Ultimately, the choice between white and red wines comes down to personal preference and the occasion. Cheers!",Compare & Contrast,
Philosophy and Curriculum,"Admittedly, education is always affected by the contemporary philosophy. For example, any teacher plans the curriculum in accordance with his/her opinion as for the main points and less important issues. Since teachers are brought up in a certain culture based on a particular philosophy they form their curricula in terms of this large context.
Moreover, teachers tend to develop not only their students’ mental activity, but they strive to foster people characterized by the major values of the culture they pertain to. Of course, it is not the most important for teacher to teach students to do sums or know where human’s heart is.
Teachers develop learners’ ethical qualities so that students become worthy members of the society. Thus, teachers try to shape their curricula so that not only student’s mind and brain but student’s soul and heart could be developed . Many educators pay much attention to the correlation between philosophy and curriculum.
For instance, Brummelen provides many effective approaches to plan the curriculum in accordance with contemporary philosophy. To my mind, he helps not only teachers but students as well since he articulates many useful points which teachers can implement. As far as students are concerned they also benefit from reading such books since they start understanding the importance of this approach. Moreover, the book enables learners to focus on what is really important.
What impressed me most was the attitude towards religion and its place in the curriculum. For instance, it is suggested that all disciplines can and should be integrated with major principles of religion.
Of course, it is not surprising when religious issues are considered during History or Literature classes. However, I was a bit startled while reading about using such principles during Biology or Physics, for example. I used to think that science and religion are in different camps since sciences always tried to debunk certain points promulgated by religion.


In its turn religious people often denied some major findings of scientists or condemned them for interfering in some divine activities. Besides, I often disliked when teachers started moralizing, so I thought that any deviations from curriculum was useless waste of time. I thought that school should provide students with pure science. However, the book impressed me greatly and made me change my mind.
I used to think that philosophical, religious and cultural principles should be learned at home, but I think that teachers can do it better since they know how to educate young people. Moreover, to my mind some ethical norms are acquired better when they come within some particular discipline.
Thus, now I admit that such integration is possible and even preferable. Whereas, nowadays teachers explain that people’s longing to knowledge and, in fact, ability to learn and perceive is given by our God. It goes without saying that contemporary students can benefit from knowledge which is accompanied by “guiding principle for life”. To my mind, curriculum is only strengthened by philosophical (religious) principles.
It is very important to make young people see what is right and what is wrong since they are exposed to so much information at present that they can easily get lost and make many mistakes. Thus, I gather that curriculum is, in any case, influenced by curriculum, so it is better if teachers know how to make students benefit from it.","Philosophy and curriculum are two interconnected aspects of education. Philosophy provides the foundation and principles for creating a curriculum that reflects the goals and objectives of education. Curriculum, on the other hand, serves as the practical application of philosophical concepts in the classroom.


Philosophy of education is concerned with the fundamental beliefs and values that guide educational practices. Philosophers of education seek to answer fundamental questions about the nature, aims, and values of education. For instance, they may ask what is the purpose of education, what is the nature of knowledge, what is the role of the teacher, and what are the aims of education. The answers to these questions can guide the development of a curriculum that aligns with the philosophical beliefs of the educators.


Curriculum is the set of courses, activities, and learning experiences that are designed to achieve the educational goals and objectives of a school or educational institution. Curriculum design involves selecting and organizing educational content and activities that reflect the educational philosophy of the school or institution. A well-designed curriculum should be aligned with the educational goals and objectives of the institution, promote the development of important skills and knowledge, and provide students with a clear and coherent path of learning.


There are several approaches to curriculum design, each of which reflects a different philosophy of education. For example, the traditional curriculum emphasizes the transmission of knowledge from teacher to student, while the progressive curriculum emphasizes the development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills. In addition, there are subject-centered, learner-centered, and society-centered curricula, each of which reflects a different philosophical perspective on education.


Philosophy and curriculum are interconnected in several ways. First, the philosophical beliefs of educators influence the development of a curriculum. For example, an educator who believes in the importance of developing critical thinking skills may design a curriculum that emphasizes problem-solving and inquiry-based learning. Second, the curriculum can reflect and reinforce philosophical beliefs. For example, a curriculum that emphasizes the transmission of knowledge may reinforce the belief that knowledge is static and unchanging. In contrast, a curriculum that emphasizes critical thinking may reflect a belief in the importance of questioning and evaluating information.


Furthermore, the curriculum can also shape and influence philosophical beliefs. For example, a curriculum that emphasizes the importance of individualism may reinforce a belief in the value of self-reliance and autonomy. Conversely, a curriculum that emphasizes the importance of social responsibility may reinforce a belief in the importance of collective action and social justice.


In conclusion, philosophy and curriculum are two interconnected aspects of education that influence and shape one another. Philosophical beliefs provide the foundation for creating a curriculum that reflects the goals and objectives of education. Curriculum, in turn, serves as the practical application of philosophical concepts in the classroom. By understanding the relationship between philosophy and curriculum, educators can create a curriculum that is aligned with their beliefs and values, promotes the development of important skills and knowledge, and provides students with a clear and coherent path of learning.",Persuasive,
Learning a Second Language,"Language is one of the most important tools in our interaction with others. Without language, it is highly unlikely that the human civilization would have developed as it has over the millenniums. For most people, being able to communicate in one language is sufficient. This is especially so if the language is English, French or Germany, all of which are internationally recognized languages.
While it is true that one can be able to comfortably go through life with the knowledge of one language, the person greatly limits his/her potential. This is because there are many advantages to be gained from being proficient in more than one language. This paper shall argue that every person should learn at least one second language so as to reap the benefits that such an undertaking brings to the individual.
We live in a world that is slowly being turned into a global village as a result of advances in transport and communication. Through the process known as globalization, major integration of economies and cultures is becoming rife. In such a world, people are constantly being forced to interact with others who come from different cultural backgrounds.
While in some cases these people from different cultures share a language, there are many instances where there is a language difference. If one has learnt at least one additional language, there is a higher possibility that communication between the people from varying cultures will be possible. As such, acquisition of an additional language will assist in bringing about harmony in a multicultural society.
Scientific studies have proved that learning of a second language may result in the enhancement of the intellectual capabilities of an individual. As a result of learning a second language, a person’s performance in arithmetic as well as his reading skills is greatly increased. This improvement is attributed to the fact that learning a new language results in divergent thinking in the person.
The divergent thinking develops since learning a new language involves not only obtaining a new vocabulary but also learning a different manner of constructing thoughts. Considering the fact that a higher intellectual capability is desirable since it increases the chances of a person succeeding in life, everyone should learn an additional language.
Being proficient in more than one language can give a person an advantage when they are applying for a job. This is because an additional language increases the versatility of an individual therefore making him a greater asset to an organization. Some organizations specifically deal with clients who do not converse in English.
It will therefore be a huge benefit for the organization if it can have a person who can converse in the native language of the clients. Having the knowledge of an additional language can therefore result in the career development of the individual.
This paper set out to argue that everyone should learn an addition language. To reinforce this assertion, this paper has discussed the various merits that acquisition of an additional language can have to not only the individual but the society at large. This paper has demonstrates that learning an additional language can result in the creation of a more harmonious global society.
In addition to this, this paper has shown that learning a different language develops one’s mental ability making them better thinkers and also increasing the individual’s chances to develop their career. For this reasons, everyone should learn at least one second language.","Learning a second language can be a challenging and rewarding experience that offers a range of personal and professional benefits. In today's globalized world, being proficient in multiple languages can be a major asset in the job market, as it opens up opportunities for working with international companies and clients, or even for living and working abroad. However, the benefits of learning a second language extend far beyond just professional opportunities. It can also enhance cognitive skills, boost memory, and provide a deeper understanding and appreciation of other cultures.

One of the key benefits of learning a second language is the cognitive boost it provides. Studies have shown that individuals who are proficient in multiple languages have better memory retention and stronger problem-solving skills. This is because learning a new language involves developing new neural pathways in the brain, which can help improve cognitive flexibility and creativity. Additionally, being bilingual or multilingual has been linked to a lower risk of cognitive decline and the onset of dementia in old age.

Another advantage of learning a second language is the ability to communicate with people from different cultures. Language is a central part of cultural identity and learning a new language allows individuals to understand and appreciate different cultures. This can lead to greater empathy and understanding of people from different backgrounds and can help to break down cultural barriers. In addition, speaking another language can help individuals to travel more easily and make connections with people from all over the world.

Learning a second language can also be a valuable asset in the job market. In many fields, being proficient in multiple languages is considered an asset, especially in industries such as tourism, international business, or translation services. Being able to speak a second language can also provide a competitive edge over other job applicants, and can even lead to higher salaries.

However, while the benefits of learning a second language are clear, the process of language learning can be challenging. It requires time, dedication, and often involves making mistakes and feeling uncomfortable in the early stages. Additionally, learning a language requires consistent practice, which can be difficult to fit into a busy schedule.

One effective way to learn a second language is through immersion. This involves surrounding oneself with the language, either by living in a country where it is spoken or by regularly interacting with native speakers. This approach allows individuals to practice the language in a natural setting and can accelerate the learning process.

Another effective method is through formal language classes, which provide a structured approach to learning and opportunities for practice with peers. This approach can be particularly useful for individuals who prefer a more structured learning environment or who need to learn a language for professional reasons.

In conclusion, learning a second language is a valuable skill that offers a range of personal and professional benefits. While the process of language learning can be challenging, the rewards are well worth the effort. With the increasingly globalized nature of our world, being proficient in multiple languages is becoming more important than ever. So, whether it is for professional development or personal enrichment, learning a second language is a worthwhile endeavor.

Problems Facing Human Beings In 2050,"Currently, infrastructure has become paramount in our daily lives. In every country, infrastructure determines the growth of its economic and social sectors. Over the last century, improvements in infrastructure have resulted in better standards of living. In spite of these benefits, environmental researchers suggest that the future advancements in infrastructure would result in numerous challenges. Currently, several countries are planning to invest massive resources in infrastructural developments.

In this regard, environmentalists assert that all the relevant stakeholders should address the future infrastructural challenges. By focusing on the future land-based transportation issues, this paper seeks to highlight challenges that would be faced by human beings in the year 2050.

At the present, the effects of climate change are widespread. According to environmentalists, by the year 2050 climate change will have increased in its intensity and occurrence. As such, climate change will ultimately have an effect on our land-based transport sectors. The increase in temperatures will affect transportation in a number of ways. Higher temperatures will lead to an expansion in the metals used in the railway lines and bridges.

As a result, bridges’ joints and the efficiency of our railway transport will be compromised. If the government fails to reconstruct our transport facilities to suit the current changes in climate, delays and accidents in the industry will be rampant by the year 2050. It is estimated that the world population in the year 2050 would be 9 billion. Owing to this factor, many individuals would be negatively affected by the situation.

Equally, recurring floods will affect both land-based transportation system and water infrastructures. In the coastal and lowland regions, climate change will result in unprecedented floods leading to an interruption in the flow of traffics. The flooding will not only interrupt traffic, but will also result in frequent infrastructure repairs and delays in construction. Similarly, bridges and motorway safety will be threatened by the consequences of climate change in the coming decades.

Personally, disruption in land-based transport systems will lead to delays, increase in the cost of travelling, and increase chances of being involved in disasters. Considering the fact that the world population would have increased significantly by the year 2050, implies that more time will be wasted travelling back and forth to the workplace. Since a significant amount of time will be spent on travelling, my production will be negatively affected leading to a decrease in my returns.

With the thoughts of future infrastructural challenges in mind, I wonder whether the challenges faced in land-based transportation system in the future will have significant effects on other infrastructural sectors. Equally, I cannot comprehend whether these challenges will reduce the economical gains achieved by then. With the ever-increasing consequences of climate change and the governments’ unwillingness to formulate appropriate mitigation measures, I wonder whether the looming risks are avoidable.

In my opinion, the threatening infrastructural challenges that would be faced by the year 2050 are real. In this regard, governments and relevant sectors must acknowledge the risks posed by these infrastructural challenges, and create and implement appropriate mitigation measures.

Similarly, environmental engineers should work together with other engineers in developing infrastructures that will sustain the risks resulting from climate change. Through this, the risks associated with the future infrastructural challenges will be reduced fostering sustainable economic growth at the present and in the future.","As we look forward to the year 2050, it is difficult to predict what the future holds for human beings. However, there are several problems that we are likely to face, based on current trends and projections. These include climate change, overpopulation, resource depletion, and technological disruption.

One of the biggest challenges we face is climate change. Rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and sea level rise are all expected to have significant impacts on human societies. Climate change may lead to food and water shortages, displacement of populations, and increased disease transmission. To address this problem, we need to take action to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, transition to renewable energy sources, and develop more sustainable land-use practices.

Another challenge is overpopulation. The global population is expected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, which will put even more pressure on our already-strained resources. We need to find ways to produce more food, water, and energy while minimizing our impact on the environment. This may involve developing new technologies, such as genetically modified crops and renewable energy sources, as well as implementing more efficient resource management practices.

Resource depletion is another problem we are likely to face in 2050. As we use up more and more resources, such as oil, gas, and minerals, it becomes increasingly difficult to find new sources. This may lead to price spikes and shortages, which could have serious economic and social consequences. To address this problem, we need to focus on developing more sustainable practices, such as recycling and using renewable resources.

Finally, technological disruption is likely to have a significant impact on human societies in 2050. Automation, artificial intelligence, and other technologies are already transforming the way we work and live, and these trends are likely to accelerate in the coming decades. While these developments may bring many benefits, they may also lead to job displacement and social upheaval. We need to find ways to ensure that the benefits of technological progress are shared widely and that we can adapt to the changes it brings.

To address these problems, we need to take action at both the individual and collective level. As individuals, we can make choices that reduce our impact on the environment, such as driving less and consuming less meat. We can also support policies and initiatives that promote sustainability, such as carbon pricing and renewable energy subsidies.

At the collective level, governments, businesses, and civil society organizations need to work together to develop and implement solutions. This may involve investing in new technologies, promoting sustainable land-use practices, and ensuring that the benefits of economic growth are shared widely. We also need to ensure that our policies are based on sound science and that they take into account the needs of future generations.

In conclusion, the problems facing human beings in 2050 are significant and complex, but they are not insurmountable. By working together and taking action now, we can ensure that we have a sustainable and prosperous future. We need to take a long-term view, focus on solutions that benefit everyone, and be willing to make difficult choices.",Argumentative,
Medical Uses of Marijuana,"Marijuana is medicinal extracts from a plant known as Cannabis sativa. Cannabis sativa contains psychoactive cannabinoids such as tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, and cannabinol amongst others. The presence of cannabinoids in Cannabis sativa gives it medicinal and scientific importance.
The use of marijuana for therapeutic purposes is very controversial as many countries consider it an illegal drug while others consider it a medicinal and legal substance. Current scientific studies have proved that marijuana can effectively cure Alzheimer’s disease, lung cancer, breast cancer and brain cancer.
Moreover, cannabinoids improve appetite, enhance blood circulation, control sleep, and is a potent analgesic. Therefore, pharmacological use of marijuana to meet safety and efficacy standards will give optimum therapeutic benefits and minimal side effects.
Since cannabinoids cause psychoactive effects, it is not quite accurate to determine the effectiveness of cannabinoids psychologically. Effective psychotherapy analysis of cannabinoids effects requires thorough understanding of their mechanism of action.
Research studies have found out that tetrahydrocannabinol accumulates in the brain fatty tissues and binds to its receptors thus producing its effects. These receptors are found in large numbers in the cerebral cortex, which is the seat of human consciousness and in areas involved in the control of skilled movement ”.


The Angel’s story that marijuana helped in movement and sped up healing process, hence medically effective, is not true since tetrahydrocannabinol stimulated brain receptors. The stimulated receptors interfered with consciousness and controlled the movement.
Marijuana is medically effective in relieving chronic pains associated with cancer and traumatic injuries. To determine the effectiveness of marijuana in relieving chronic pains, I would first consider legal, ethical, social, and medical aspects of the study.
On the study, I would select 12 patients who are suffering from chronic pain and divide them into three groups; one group administer with conventional analgesic, another to administer with marijuana and the last group to administer with a placebo.
“Precautions to insure neutrality of drug, set and setting, including use of a double-blind procedure as an absolute minimum, are vitally important if the object of investigation is to measure real marijuana-induced responses”.
Comparative studies of the conventional analgesic and marijuana effects will prove the effectiveness of marijuana as analgesic while comparative studies with placebo effect will give the extent of psychological illusions. This study will give credible findings regarding marijuana as analgesic.
Regular use of psychoactive drugs such as marijuana would cause adverse side effects. Mental side effects such as paranoia, dizziness, and hallucinations occur when an individual takes high and regular doses. According to Mohamed, “…smoked or oral marijuana doses or even ordinary doses taken by a sensitive, inexperienced, or predisposed person can produce transient anxiety, panic, feelings of depression and other dysphoric mood changes, depersonalization, bizarre behaviors, delusions, illusions, or hallucinations”.
The feelings of hallucination make one to lose consciousness and feel as though in very different world that is full of bliss. Another potential side effect is cardiovascular and automotive effects. “A consistent, prominent, and sudden effect of marijuana is a 20 to 100 percent increase in heart rate lasting up to 2 to 3 hours”.
Increased heart beat rate predisposes hypertension and heart attack. The real world examples are the Rasta people in Jamaica and all over the world who consider marijuana as medicine and source of inspiration in their religion. This has predisposed them to hallucinations and cardiovascular diseases.


","Marijuana, also known as cannabis, is a psychoactive drug that has been used for both recreational and medicinal purposes for centuries. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the medical uses of marijuana, with a growing body of research suggesting that it may have potential therapeutic benefits for a range of conditions. In this essay, we will explore the medical uses of marijuana, its potential benefits and risks, and the legal landscape surrounding its use.

One of the most well-known medical uses of marijuana is for the treatment of chronic pain. Studies have found that cannabinoids, the active compounds in marijuana, may be effective in reducing pain, particularly in patients with chronic conditions such as multiple sclerosis, neuropathic pain, and cancer-related pain. Some studies have even found that marijuana may be more effective than traditional pain medications, such as opioids, with fewer side effects.

Another potential use of marijuana is for the treatment of mental health conditions, such as anxiety and depression. Some studies have suggested that marijuana may be effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety, and may even be as effective as prescription anti-anxiety medications. Similarly, some research has found that marijuana may have antidepressant effects, although more research is needed to fully understand its potential in this area.

Marijuana has also been studied for its potential use in the treatment of neurological disorders, such as epilepsy and multiple sclerosis. Some research has found that cannabinoids may help reduce seizures in patients with epilepsy, and may also be effective in reducing muscle spasms and other symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis.

In addition to these potential medical uses, marijuana has also been studied for its potential role in the treatment of various other conditions, such as glaucoma, inflammatory bowel disease, and even cancer. While some studies have suggested that marijuana may have benefits in these areas, more research is needed to fully understand its potential and to determine the most effective dosages and delivery methods.

While there is growing interest in the potential medical uses of marijuana, there are also risks and concerns associated with its use. One of the main concerns is the potential for addiction and abuse, particularly among those who use it for recreational purposes. There is also some evidence to suggest that long-term use of marijuana may have negative effects on cognitive function, particularly in young people.

Another concern is the potential for side effects, which can include dizziness, drowsiness, and impaired coordination. Some studies have also suggested that marijuana use may increase the risk of psychosis, particularly in those with a history of mental health issues.

Despite these risks and concerns, the legal landscape surrounding the use of marijuana for medical purposes is changing. As of 2021, more than 30 states in the US have legalized medical marijuana, while others have decriminalized its use. However, marijuana remains illegal at the federal level, which creates a complex legal landscape for patients and healthcare providers.

In conclusion, while more research is needed to fully understand the potential medical uses of marijuana, there is growing evidence to suggest that it may have therapeutic benefits for a range of conditions. However, there are also risks and concerns associated with its use, particularly when used recreationally or without proper medical supervision. As the legal landscape continues to evolve, it will be important to carefully consider both the potential benefits and risks of marijuana for medical purposes, and to ensure that patients have access to safe and effective treatments.

Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe,"Traditional religion as well as religious beliefs and practices are important issues which are discussed in ‘Things Fall Apart’ by Chinua Achebe. The major theme focuses on the conflict between the Igbo society and culture as well as the religion of the colonists.

The Umuofia society is religious as it is characterized by the worship of Chuckwu the chief the god, spirits and the ancestors. It is clear that the religion practiced in Umuofia is animistic in nature similar to other traditional religions in other parts of Africa. The people of Umuofia believed that most of both the living and non living things had the ability of possessing souls and the spirits.

For instance, members of the society believed that forests like the evil forests had sprits of evil and that is why twins were abandoned there as they were considered to carry bad luck. Further studies indicate that it was possible for a man to buy a craving in the market and make it to be an object of worship after invoking his spirit in it. There were other spirits like the spirits of rivers, lakes, wells and the earth, to name just a few.

In the Umuofia society, men and women were regarded differently as they did not hold the same positions. For instance, men were rulers as well as leaders while women were considered as servants.

Therefore, the spirits of women were inferior to the spirits of men although women were also allowed to carry out religious rituals since they could become priests. According to Achebe (pp. 30), the Umuofia community had a female deity who was known as ‘Ani’. In addition, there was also a male deity who was known as Agbala or the ‘Oracle of the Hills and the Caves’ (Achebe pp.30).

According to Achebe, ‘chi’ was a personal god for an individual which had the ability to follow people throughout their whole life. One of the major characteristic of ‘chi’ was the fact that it was capable of either being good or bad. Such a characteristic was very important because it determined the success of an individual.

Therefore, incase someone had a good ‘chi’, such a person ended up being successful while people with a bad chi were full of misfortunes. However, although ‘chi’ was powerful, a person had the power of determining his destiny. In addition, medicine men could intervene and help someone with a bad ‘chi’ to become successful.

The Umoufia society was powerful among its neighbors and was greatly feared. The neighbors considered going into war with it as a last option, incase all the other options failed. The priests and medicine men who were vey powerful contributed greatly to its superiority. Its source of the military power was the war medicine although the age of the same was not known. The medicine which was the source of the strength was known as agadi-nwayi which meant an old woman.

Villagers believed that an old woman with one leg was often seen by someone who passed by the shrine which was centrally placed in the evenings. Since the villagers believed that she was sacrificed when the village was being formed, that explains why she was capable of being powerful. In addition, the villagers believed that performing religious practices and rituals made someone to be powerful. As a result, the woman could have derived her power from the sacrifices that took place during the formation of the village.","Chinua Achebe's novel, Things Fall Apart, is a powerful work that explores the complexities of colonialism and its effects on African societies. Set in pre-colonial Nigeria, the novel follows the story of Okonkwo, a proud and ambitious leader of the Igbo people. Through Okonkwo's experiences, Achebe highlights the clash between traditional African values and the values of the colonizers.

One of the major themes of the novel is the importance of community and tradition. Okonkwo's village is governed by a set of customs and beliefs that have been passed down through generations. These traditions shape the lives of the villagers and provide a sense of identity and belonging. However, as the colonial powers begin to exert their influence, the traditional way of life is threatened. Missionaries arrive and attempt to convert the villagers to Christianity, while the colonizers impose their own legal and economic systems.

Achebe's portrayal of the colonizers is complex. On one hand, they are depicted as cruel and exploitative, using violence and deception to gain control over the indigenous people. On the other hand, Achebe acknowledges that some of the colonizers genuinely believed that they were bringing civilization to a backward society. This nuanced portrayal of the colonizers reflects the complexity of the colonial encounter and the conflicting perspectives of those involved.

The character of Okonkwo is central to the novel. He is a man of great strength and pride, but his rigid adherence to tradition and his fear of weakness lead to his downfall. Okonkwo's tragic fate underscores the theme of the tension between tradition and change. His inability to adapt to the changing world around him leads to his alienation from his community and his ultimate suicide.

One of the strengths of Achebe's writing is his use of language. The novel is written in English, but Achebe incorporates Igbo words and phrases throughout the text. This use of language reinforces the cultural richness of the Igbo people and highlights the importance of language as a vehicle for cultural expression.

Things Fall Apart is a groundbreaking work that has had a profound impact on African literature and postcolonial studies. It challenges the simplistic narratives of colonialism that were prevalent in Western literature at the time of its publication and presents a more nuanced and complex view of the colonial encounter. Achebe's powerful prose and vivid characters make the novel a compelling read that continues to resonate with readers today.

In conclusion, Things Fall Apart is a powerful work that explores the complexities of colonialism and its effects on African societies. Through the character of Okonkwo, Achebe highlights the tension between tradition and change and the importance of community in shaping individual identity. The novel's nuanced portrayal of the colonizers reflects the complexity of the colonial encounter and challenges simplistic narratives of the time. With its rich language and vivid characters, Things Fall Apart continues to be a powerful and important work in African literature and postcolonial studies.",Analytical,
The Concept of Metaphysics and Nature,"Everything that happens in nature seems to follow a certain order. For instance, a river has tributaries that flow in a certain direction. The river also follows a certain course and may drain in a larger water body that is far away from where the river originated. For order to exist there has to be a driving force.
I believe that there exists a powerful force that dictates the order that nature follows. This force is more powerful than any other force in the universe. I believe that this force is God. God is omnipotent and omnipresent. As God is not physically visible, I therefore believe in the existence of a spiritual realm. This realm consists of other spiritual beings for example angels.
I also believe in the existence of free will. Human beings are able to differentiate between right and wrong. They have the free will to choose what to do, be it right or wrong. With the existence of a spiritual realm, I believe in the existence of the soul and life after death. When the physical body dies, the soul lives on in the spiritual realm.
A good example of the order in nature is a seed. When a seed is planted, it germinates into a seedling and later grows into a tree. Another example is how insects such as butterflies follow the egg – larva – pupa – adult stages of development. Existence of rivers, lakes, oceans, deserts and forests exhibits order.
The different ecosystems support different life forms and this also shows order. For example, numerous species of fish can only survive in fresh water bodies while others can only survive in salty water bodies. None of them however can survive on land.
This shows that there is order in nature. Everything that happens is driven by a force. All these forces also require a driving force and this is where God comes in. He is the supreme force that drives all other forces in nature and in the entire universe.
I believe that everything in existence was created by God. I therefore reject the alternative philosophies of existence. These include the theories of evolution and the big bang. It is not possible for an ape to evolve into a human being as the two belong to different species. Evolution cannot explain the existence of other life species like the numerous plants that come in all shapes and sizes.
The big bang theory also cannot explain the existence of life and the order in nature. None of the two theories can explain the existence of earth and the other planets or even the existence of life after death and the spiritual realm.
Having this understanding will assist me to keep focused in life. I will appreciate the beauty and wonders of nature more. The knowledge of God will make me live a life that is morally upright. To keep with the Godly ways, I will endeavor to assist the less privileged in the society and to avoid oppressing other people. In order to take care of my body, I will eat healthy meals and exercise regularly.
To prepare my soul for the afterlife, I will follow the religious teachings and exercise my free will to choose right over wrong. I will also study hard to gain more knowledge on things that will assist me in life.","Metaphysics is a branch of philosophy that seeks to understand the fundamental nature of reality, including the relationship between mind and matter, substance and attribute, and cause and effect. It deals with the nature of existence, reality, and knowledge, exploring questions about the nature of the universe, existence, and the ultimate meaning of life. The concept of metaphysics has been a subject of debate and discussion for centuries, with many philosophers offering different interpretations of its meaning and purpose. In this essay, I will discuss the concept of metaphysics and its relationship to nature.
The term ""metaphysics"" comes from the Greek words ""meta,"" meaning beyond, and ""physics,"" which refers to the study of the natural world. Metaphysics is concerned with the study of reality beyond the physical world, exploring concepts such as the nature of time, space, causation, and the ultimate nature of reality. It seeks to understand the world beyond what we can see and touch, using reason and intuition to explore the fundamental nature of existence.
One of the central themes of metaphysics is the concept of nature. Nature refers to the natural world, including all living and non-living things. Metaphysics seeks to understand the fundamental nature of the world, exploring questions such as whether the world is composed of one substance or many, and whether the natural world is fundamentally different from the human world.
In the philosophy of metaphysics, there are different schools of thought regarding the concept of nature. One school of thought is idealism, which holds that reality is fundamentally mental or spiritual in nature. According to idealism, the physical world is a manifestation of the mind or consciousness, and the world is ultimately non-material in nature.


Another school of thought is materialism, which holds that the natural world is composed of matter and energy, and that everything can be explained in terms of physical laws and properties. Materialists argue that the human mind is a product of physical processes in the brain, and that there is no separate spiritual or mental realm.
A third school of thought is dualism, which holds that the world is composed of two fundamentally different substances: matter and mind or consciousness. According to dualism, the mind and the body are separate and distinct entities, and the mind can exist independently of the physical body.
Regardless of the specific school of thought, metaphysics seeks to understand the nature of reality beyond the physical world, exploring questions about the nature of existence, reality, and the ultimate meaning of life. Metaphysics can be seen as a way of exploring the big questions about life and the universe, using reason and intuition to understand the fundamental nature of existence.
In conclusion, the concept of metaphysics is concerned with understanding the fundamental nature of reality, including the relationship between mind and matter, substance and attribute, and cause and effect. The concept of nature is a central theme in metaphysics, and different schools of thought offer different interpretations of the nature of reality. Regardless of the specific school of thought, metaphysics seeks to understand the world beyond what we can see and touch, using reason and intuition to explore the fundamental nature of existence. By exploring these big questions about life and the universe, metaphysics can offer insights into the ultimate meaning of life and the nature of existence.",Personal,
Comparison Between Islamic Story of Creation and Bing Bang Theory,"The relationship between the Islamic story of creation and the scientific ‘Big Bang’ theory presents two relatively similar concepts that seem to agree on certain occurrences about creation.

In the ‘big bang’ theory of creation, scientists believe that the universe keeps on expanding with time as a result of the big bang that took place 13-15 billion years ago (Smith & Worden, 2003).

Scientists argue that before the big bang, everything existed in concentrated tiny dense mass. However, this scientific theory does not explain the main source of the matter. Instead, it only states that a tremendous explosion caused the scattering of the particle into an expanding universe.

Scientists believe that even today the different galaxies are separating from one another and that a process known as red shift explains this occurrence.

Furthermore, the big bang theory; believe that the stars and planets were formed as a result of the cooling effect on the galaxy. This process led to the formation of the solar system some 4.5 billion years ago and eventually life began on earth.

One the other hand, the Islamic story of creation believes that a supreme God called Allah created the heavens in six days from nothing and that this God controls the universe and its existence.

It is worth noting that the Islamic story of creation shares many concepts with the ‘big bang’ theory. Many scholars argue that the big bang theory does not bruise the Islamic beliefs; on the contrary, it has influenced the correlation between science and religion. However, this does not hold true for Christianity.

Various similarities exist between the scientific big bang theory and the Islamic story of creation. The Quran also asserted that Allah created the heavens and all that is between them in six days.

This translates to almost 50,000 years according to the Quran. It further allows the Islamic creation story significantly more congruence and less conflict with modern science and the ‘big bang’ theory.

These similarities show how the Islamic belief in the story of creation shares the same perceptions with the big bang theory. In addition to that, Islamic has embraced science in explaining some concepts of religion.

This has led to the formation of a science-religion relationship between the two principles. However, much as Islamic belief agrees with science, it expresses different views when science compromises Islamic religious values. An example is the issue of birth control that Islam does not agree with.

To summarize this argument, various evidences clearly shows that the Islamic story of creation shares similar concepts with the big bang theory and that Islam and science are not in contention. On the contrary, they relate to each other on different angles.

The similarity between the Islamic theory of creation and that of ‘big bang’ is just. They both corresponds with modern cosmology’s ‘big bang’ theory that at some point particles came together and then continued to gather.

In science, even the smallest particles-electrons and protons, or even smaller still, quarks-all have an energetic charge. This is true also of the Islamic views- there is constant and continuous energy in everything, absolutely everything.","The Islamic story of creation and the Big Bang theory are two very different explanations of how the universe came into existence. The Islamic creation story, as described in the Quran, is a theological account of how God created the universe in six days, while the Big Bang theory is a scientific explanation based on observations and data. Despite their differences, these two narratives share some similarities and can be compared in terms of their underlying themes and key elements.

The Islamic story of creation begins with the phrase ""In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth."" This verse suggests that God is the creator of the universe and everything in it. According to Islamic theology, God created the universe in six days and rested on the seventh. This is a fundamental belief in Islam, and it serves as the basis for the Islamic worldview.

In contrast, the Big Bang theory is a scientific explanation of how the universe came into existence. It is based on observations and data, and it proposes that the universe began as a singularity and then expanded rapidly. This theory suggests that the universe is about 13.8 billion years old, and it is still expanding.

One of the key similarities between the Islamic story of creation and the Big Bang theory is that they both suggest that the universe had a beginning. In the Islamic creation story, God created the universe out of nothing, and in the Big Bang theory, the universe began as a singularity. Both narratives suggest that the universe was not always there, but had a specific beginning.

Another similarity between the Islamic story of creation and the Big Bang theory is that they both suggest that the universe is ordered and follows certain laws. In the Islamic creation story, God created the universe in a specific order, and in the Big Bang theory, the universe is governed by physical laws. Both narratives suggest that the universe is not random, but follows a specific order and pattern.

Despite these similarities, the Islamic story of creation and the Big Bang theory differ in their approach and the level of detail provided. The Islamic creation story is a theological account that focuses on God's power and his creation of the universe in six days. It provides little detail on how the universe was created, and the focus is on the power and majesty of God.

In contrast, the Big Bang theory is a scientific explanation that is based on observations and data. It provides a detailed account of how the universe came into existence and how it has evolved over time. The focus is on understanding the physical laws that govern the universe and how they have shaped its history.

In conclusion, the Islamic story of creation and the Big Bang theory are two very different explanations of how the universe came into existence. While they share some similarities, such as the suggestion that the universe had a beginning and follows certain laws, they differ in their approach and level of detail. The Islamic creation story is a theological account that focuses on God's power, while the Big Bang theory is a scientific explanation that is based on observations and data. Both narratives offer unique perspectives on the creation of the universe, and they can be appreciated for their insights into the nature of the universe and our place in it.",Expository,
Video Games and Violence in Children,"One of the most fundamental questions that psychologists ask themselves is what leads to violent behavior in people. There have been arguments that such behavior is as a result of a pre-disposition to violence in the media as well as in video games.
This theory is heavily criticized as it is supported. Proponents of this theory claim that playing video games especially by children may lead a psychological formation of violent behavior; however, opponents of this theory claim that there is too much violence in the society and that video games cannot be solely blamed for such violence.
It has been found out that the average child plays an average of about 43 minutes of video games every day. Proponents of the theory explain that video games leads to violent behavior argue that active participation in an activity reinforces learning.
As such when children actively play these video games they are actually learning and involuntarily adopting violent behavior. This is because exposure to video games leads to imitation and further modeling of violent behavior.
This theory is further supported by the fact that repetitive action increases learning about that action, thus repeated playing some video games increases the chances that they will be violent.
It also argued that playing video games has more than physical effect on the child. Exposure to video games has cognitive as well as psychological arousal.
The child cognitively grows knowing violence as a way of life. The child thus builds violent emotions involuntarily, which leads to violent behavior. It has also been found out that children who are exposed to violent games grow to be anti social.
On the other hand, this theory has been greatly criticized. To begin with, critics argue that there are concourse studies on the effects of video games on children behavior that can lead to such strong conclusions.
This is because there are no valid procedures that can measure the effects of video games. Such studies also have several weaknesses. It is argued that those who study the effects of violent video games on children fail to have a parallel study on non violent video games.


Furthermore there are a number of positive effects of playing violent video games on children. Other than being active in video games activity, video games act as avenues for children learn how to compete with each other.
Such competition is done of friendly basin and as such reinforces friendship bonds between children. Furthermore children also derive a lot of satisfaction from teaching their playmates how to play and win in such games.
Therefore video games act as a motivator to other socially constructive behaviors that are helpful to the normal growth and development of a child. Therefore violent behavior in children can be attributed to other factors such as the broken social-cultural norms as well as mal-functional homes.
It is factual that exposure for a long time to video games does involuntarily and over a long period of time shape a child’s emotions and cognitions to accommodate a lot of violence as a normal way of life. Moreover violence that is in video games is very similar to violence on the television and as such there is a relationship between violent behavior and exposure to violent video games.
As such the effects of video games cannot be ignored, However, there need to be done extensive studies which will yield conclusive findings that will finally link exposure to v violent video games to violent behavior.","Video games have become a popular pastime for children and adults alike. With the rise of advanced gaming technology, concerns about the effect of video games on children have also grown. One of the most significant concerns is the potential link between video games and violence in children. While there is some evidence to support this link, the topic remains controversial. This essay will explore the relationship between video games and violence in children, including the evidence for and against this link.


One of the arguments for the link between video games and violence is that violent video games can desensitize children to violence. Studies have shown that children who play violent video games are more likely to show aggressive behavior, compared to those who do not play violent video games. This suggests that playing violent video games can lead to a desensitization to violence, making it more acceptable to engage in violent behavior.


Additionally, some studies have found that playing violent video games can lead to an increase in aggressive thoughts and emotions. This can result in a higher likelihood of aggressive behavior, as children are more likely to act on these aggressive impulses. Furthermore, studies have also shown that exposure to violent video games can lead to changes in brain function, including increased activity in the amygdala, which is responsible for emotional regulation and the fight-or-flight response.


However, there is also evidence that suggests that video games may not be the sole cause of violent behavior in children. Other factors, such as family environment, mental health, and socioeconomic status, may also play a role. Additionally, many children who play violent video games do not show any signs of increased aggression. This suggests that while video games may be a contributing factor, they are not the only factor that influences violent behavior in children.


Moreover, there are also studies that have found no significant link between video games and violence in children. For example, a study by the University of Oxford found that there was no evidence to suggest that violent video games caused aggression in children. This study followed over 1,000 children and found that there was no difference in aggressive behavior between those who played violent video games and those who did not.


It is important to note that not all video games are violent, and that many video games can have positive effects on children. For example, video games can improve cognitive skills such as problem-solving, decision-making, and spatial awareness. They can also be used as a tool for education, as many video games are designed to teach children about history, science, and other subjects.


In conclusion, while there is some evidence to support the link between video games and violence in children, the topic remains controversial. Studies have shown that violent video games can desensitize children to violence, increase aggressive thoughts and emotions, and lead to changes in brain function. However, other factors such as family environment and mental health may also play a role, and there are also studies that have found no significant link between video games and violence. It is important to consider the potential risks and benefits of video games and to monitor children’s exposure to violent content. Ultimately, it is up to parents and guardians to decide what video games are appropriate for their children and to monitor their behavior for signs of aggression.",Argumentative,
