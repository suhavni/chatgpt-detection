Employee Performance Software and Its Benefits,"The implementation of Employee Performance Software (EPS) may seem to increase the quality of work that employees execute. Kirchmer states that firms should continuously perfect “process-related” models to achieve better results, making their staff’s productivity an essential topic for discussion. Through the inclusion of EPS in worker-evaluation rubrics, companies may obtain a more productive organizational structure that is directly beneficial for them.

EPS permits focusing on the quality of production, rather than merely on high-performance. Harnessing the already present productivity to supply quality, thus, becomes plausible for firms through closely monitoring hired employees and their working habits. As a supporting example, the use of EPS in my college allows the administration to take into consideration students’ effort as well as grades.

EPS may become a new, modern, and technological way of cultivating previously existing efficiency within a variety of organizations. Groups, which are organized competently, are more effective at achieving “a common goal,” making them more appealing qualitatively and quantitatively.

Stress Can Affect Future Generations’ Genes,"The fact that increased stress has an adverse effect on genes is a matter confirmed by numerous research. For instance, a study conducted by Powell et al. revealed that increased exposure to social stress might lead to an increased number of inflammatory diseases. In other words, stress affects the sympathetic nervous system and changes the way genes activate immune cells. The results of the research lead to the assumption that stress can affect any genes and even transform the genes of future generations.

In fact, Coghlan states that numerous DNA analysis of mice confirms the existence of epigenetic inheritance. The notion refers to the fact that “the genetic impacts of environmental factors such as smoking, diet, stressed childhoods, famine, and psychiatric disease can be passed down to future generations”. This practically means that the experiences of our grandparents can affect our choices and health issues even after hundreds of years.","Recent studies have shown that stress can affect future generations' genes. According to research, traumatic experiences can cause changes to DNA that can be passed on to offspring. These changes can lead to alterations in the way genes are expressed, potentially leading to negative health outcomes such as mental health disorders and chronic diseases.

One study found that mice that were exposed to stressors had offspring that showed signs of increased anxiety and depression. Another study found that the children of Holocaust survivors had altered stress hormone levels, indicating that the traumatic experiences of their parents had been passed down to them.

This research highlights the importance of addressing stress and trauma not only for an individual's well-being but also for future generations. It emphasizes the need to promote mental health and reduce stressors in our daily lives to ensure the health of our descendants. Understanding the impact of stress on future generations' genes can help us to make better decisions to promote long-term health and well-being.",Expository,

Food Distribution and Water Pollution,"Measures to address food insecurities can become a reason for water pollution. Today, products bought at supermarkets are heavily processed and packaged. Food packaging is a source of water pollution, as much garbage ends up in the ocean affecting different ecosystems. According to National Geographic, in the North Pacific Ocean, there is a collection of marine debris consisting of plastic bags, bottle caps, plastic water bottles, and Styrofoam cups. The majority of the trash comes from land activity, specifically from the food industry. Therefore, food distribution is one of the central reasons for water pollution.

One of the ways to diminish the negative impact on the water supply people should reduce the amount of plastic used daily. According to Greenpeace, one of the ways to improve the ecology of the planet is by creating healthy food markets. Pledging to buy sustainable or organic fresh produce whenever possible and avoiding processed food can reduce not only the amount of plastic used for packaging but also cut greenhouse gas emissions (Greenpeace). Therefore, everyday individual choices can significantly influence the ecological situation in the world.","Food distribution and water pollution are two interconnected issues that have significant impacts on our health and the environment. The way we distribute food has a direct impact on the quality of our water supply. Agricultural practices such as the use of pesticides and fertilizers can contaminate water sources, leading to pollution and potential health risks for those who consume the water.

Moreover, food distribution systems that rely on long-distance transportation can contribute to pollution through carbon emissions. These emissions can also have adverse effects on our environment and contribute to climate change.

It is important to consider the impact of food distribution on water pollution when making decisions about how we grow, distribute, and consume our food. Sustainable agriculture practices, such as organic farming and reduced pesticide use, can help to mitigate the impact of food production on water quality.

Drama Elements Developed by Aristotle,"Aristotle came up with six very important elements of drama. The first is a character which simply means the people in a story. The second is a plot that explains what takes place in a drama and at what time. The third is an idea which is forms the basis of the drama for it to be written. The fourth is a language that encompasses how the actors speak and what they will say. The fifth is music which is very important and has to be incorporated into the drama.

The sixth is a spectacle which is the visuals in the drama that include props, set, and actor’s costumes. A tragic hero serves as a major character in a tragic drama. An example of a tragic hero is King Macbeth in Shakespeare’s The Tragedy of Macbeth. A tragic flaw describes the trait of a character that results in his/her eventual downfall. A tragic rhythm involves the drama’s purpose becoming the passion that then changes to perception.","Aristotle, the ancient Greek philosopher, was one of the first scholars to write extensively on drama and its elements. According to Aristotle, a successful play should have six key elements: plot, character, thought, diction, music, and spectacle.

The plot is the storyline of the play, and it should have a beginning, middle, and end, with a clear cause-and-effect relationship between events. Characters should be well-developed and have a clear motivation for their actions. Thought refers to the themes and ideas explored in the play, while diction refers to the language and dialogue used by the characters. Music and spectacle refer to the sound and visual elements of the production.

Aristotle's elements of drama have had a lasting impact on the art form and continue to be used by playwrights and directors today. By incorporating these elements into their work, artists can create compelling and impactful plays that resonate with audiences.",Expository,
"Rocks and Minerals: Aplite, Coal, Quartz, Feldspar","Aplite is an intrusive rock containing the quartz and feldspar mineral; aplite rocks have a grey, whitish, or pinkish color, and they are excellent. Additionally, aplite crystals are quite defective and solidify almost immediately, but they fit closely similar to the mosaic grains; however, the grains for aplite crystals are very small and can only be visible using a magnifying lens.

While coal rocks are sedimentary rocks formed through biochemical reactions and are mostly related to shale, sandstone, and limestone, they differ from aplite in color since they are black, dark brown, or gray and also have a glassy texture that is unique. Commonly the coal rocks contain various minerals such as graphite, pyrite, and mineraloid. They have diverse uses since they act as sources of energy, source of carbon, and even act as lubricants.

On the other hand, quartz and feldspar are both minerals on earth surfaces but differ in various ways; quartz, for instance, is mostly found in sedimentary and metamorphic rocks while feldspar is found in granite bodies; the Quartz minerals are said to be much harder than feldspar.","Rocks and minerals play an essential role in our daily lives, and their importance cannot be overemphasized. Among the many types of rocks and minerals, Aplite, Coal, Quartz, and Feldspar are some of the most commonly used.

Aplite is a type of igneous rock that is rich in feldspar and is commonly used as a building material. Coal, on the other hand, is a sedimentary rock that is primarily composed of carbon and is used as a fuel source for power generation. Quartz is a mineral that is abundant in the Earth's crust and is widely used in the manufacturing of glass and electronics. Feldspar is another mineral that is commonly found in rocks and is used in the production of ceramics, glass, and other materials.

While these rocks and minerals are essential, their extraction and use have been linked to environmental degradation and pollution. Mining and extraction of coal, for example, have been associated with environmental pollution and health hazards. The extraction and use of aplite and feldspar also have significant environmental impacts.

Therefore, it is essential that we balance the use of these essential resources with environmental sustainability. This can be achieved through the adoption of sustainable mining practices and the development of alternative, environmentally-friendly materials. In conclusion, while rocks and minerals such as Aplite, Coal, Quartz, and Feldspar are essential, their use must be balanced with environmental sustainability.

International Relations and the Changing Contemporary World of States,"International Relations theories are generally associated with the states and their systems. The state is considered to be a country since it has its national government and residents. Furthermore, the state is viewed as a legal institution in its relations with others. In addition, it is considered to be a substantial political-economic organization: its efficiency is determined according to economic basis, political organizations, and national union.
The state’s power is identified by its organizations’ capability rather than its territory. For instance, most relatively large western states have not formed a strong national government like Nigeria or Congo. Consequently, as they cannot meet expectations regarding freedom, progress, or justice, it becomes a global problem. However, International Relations are dynamic and alternate with the political and economic modifications.
Thus, even undeveloped states can advance their national governments. Overall, as International Relations change, the states governments alternate. Political organizations are not consistent and are adjusted according to the ongoing global problems in state regulation. Moreover, the states tend to cooperate to gain mutual benefits in trade, international markets, and even technological knowledge. In addition, they collaborate to deal with critical issues with norms of reciprocity.
","The study of international relations has become increasingly important in the changing contemporary world of states. The current global political landscape is characterized by economic interdependence, technological advancements, and an interconnected global community.

The study of international relations explores the interactions between states and non-state actors, including international organizations and transnational corporations. This field seeks to understand the political, economic, and social dynamics that shape global governance and diplomacy.

In recent years, international relations have undergone significant changes, with the rise of emerging powers and the decline of traditional superpowers. This has led to a shift in the balance of power and the emergence of new regional and global actors. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for international cooperation and coordination in addressing global challenges.

In conclusion, the study of international relations is essential in the contemporary world of states, as it allows us to understand the complex interactions and interdependence between nations and the forces that shape global governance. As the world continues to change, the study of international relations will remain vital in helping us navigate the complexities of the global political landscape.",Expository,

However, there are several complications to the nature of the Internet, the environment of which might encourage some undesired discussions to thrive. Randall describes the challenges regarding the freedom of speech raised by the Internet, such as anonymity and poor adaptation of mass communication to the cyber environment. For example, companies have to rely on automatic systems to regulate harmful expression; however, often, these systems are triggered by legitimate and non-harmful internet posts. According to the lecture slides, “anonymity undermines the accountability that makes journalism credible.” Despite that it provides some level of protection to the reporter, the information cannot be completely reliable and free from hateful expression.","Freedom of expression on the internet is a contentious issue. While it is a fundamental human right, it is also subject to certain limitations, such as laws that prohibit hate speech and incitement to violence. The internet, being a global platform, presents challenges in balancing freedom of expression with cultural and social norms. The spread of misinformation and fake news further complicates this issue, as it can have real-world consequences.

In recent years, there have been concerns about censorship by social media platforms and governments, with some arguing that it poses a threat to freedom of expression. On the other hand, others argue that regulation is necessary to combat hate speech, disinformation, and cyberbullying.

Ultimately, the challenge is to strike a balance between freedom of expression and responsible use of the internet. It is essential to protect free speech while also addressing the potential harm that can arise from its abuse. Governments and social media companies must work together to find a solution that safeguards both freedom of expression and the well-being of individuals and communities.",Expository,
Social Conformity in Solomon Asch’s Experiments,"Solomon Asch’s experiments revealing the phenomenon of social conformity show us how dramatically the group pressure can change our judgments and decisions. In this classic experiment, the real participants succumbed to the influence of “fake” participants who deliberately gave wrong answers to a simple question. That happened just because the “fake” participants constituted a majority.
Like any student, I often experienced peer pressure during my school years. This is the time when you try to fit into the team and often think that someone is cleverer than you are. I remember the situation in the 6th grade when I was forced to join the class in their decision to skip the last boring Geography lesson. In spite of being strongly opposed to playing truant, I had to agree because otherwise I would remain a scapegoat for the whole year for not receiving punishment from the teacher along with other students. The situation is a bit different from the one in Asch’s experiment but reflects the same psychological phenomenon.","Solomon Asch’s conformity experiments demonstrated that individuals tend to conform to the opinions of a majority group, even when those opinions are clearly incorrect. In his experiments, participants were shown a series of lines and asked to identify which one was the same length as a reference line. However, unbeknownst to the participant, the other group members were actually confederates who deliberately gave incorrect answers.

Asch found that the presence of these confederates led participants to conform to the group consensus, even when it was obviously wrong. The experiment highlights the power of social pressure and the importance of individual independence in decision-making.

Overall, Asch's experiments provide insight into the dynamics of group behavior and the potential for individuals to abandon their own beliefs in favor of group consensus. The findings suggest the importance of critical thinking and the need for individuals to resist the pressure to conform, especially when it goes against their own beliefs and values.",Personal,
The Need for Government Control of Alcohol and Cigarettes,"The production and distribution of cigarettes should be criminalized due to the fact that smoking influences various diseases. Thus, it causes cancer, diabetes, and heart illness and leads to death. Moreover, tobacco is highly addictive, people who smoke do not even live a few hours without a cigarette; they become aggressive. The added effect of smoking is that it produces passive dependence on other people. Accordingly, smoking in public places should also be banned, which will reduce the incidence of second-hand smoke and reduce the risk of disease.

In modern society, people drink alcohol often, so they argue about its positivity and negative consequences. It should be remarked that the reasonable use of alcohol can help protect against diabetes and promotes heart function. However, alcohol consumption is a significant cause of death because many people cannot control their desire to drink. Accordingly, alcohol should be controlled; one way is to ban its sale after eleven o’clock in the evening. This measure will assist decrease the opportunity to buy alcohol for adults, adolescents, and students. If they want to spend time together in the evening, they will use drinks that are allowed.","The need for government control of alcohol and cigarettes has been a topic of debate for decades. Both substances are legal and easily accessible, yet they have been linked to numerous health issues and social problems.

Excessive alcohol consumption is a major public health concern, leading to liver disease, cancer, and other health problems. In addition, it can contribute to social issues such as violence, crime, and family problems. Cigarettes, on the other hand, are a leading cause of preventable deaths, with lung cancer and other respiratory diseases being the most common health consequences.

Government control of alcohol and cigarettes can take various forms, such as taxation, advertising restrictions, and age limits. These measures are designed to discourage excessive consumption and reduce the negative health and social impacts of these substances.

In conclusion, government control of alcohol and cigarettes is necessary to protect public health and reduce the negative social impacts of these substances. While individuals should have the freedom to make their own choices, government intervention can help to ensure that these choices do not have harmful consequences for themselves and others.",Argumentative,
Human Resource Development: Positive and Negative Aspects,"I would like to tell you more about my experience of working as an accountant in a company, outlining positive and negative aspects. As with any job, the most rewarding and beneficial experience was associated with getting to know different kinds of people and learning from them about accounting. I learned how to approach people when I had a problem, or I needed advice. Even though my job was predominantly working on my own, I still managed to interact with others regularly and observe how they were doing their job. To me, gaining knowledge from others was the most rewarding experience.

The negative experience associated with my job as an accountant was related to the fact that the HRD head of the company did not regularly interact with employees. In the majority of instances, he rarely came out of his office; thus, many issues remained unresolved for weeks. As a future HRD specialist, I believe that developing good communication patterns with employees contributes to a company’s success. Without it, employees are unable to get the necessary training and support to become more productive and efficient in their work.","Human Resource Development (HRD) is a critical component of any successful organization. As someone who has worked in HR, I have seen firsthand the positive and negative aspects of HRD.

On the positive side, HRD can lead to improved job satisfaction, productivity, and employee retention. When employees are given opportunities for training, development, and career growth, they are more likely to feel valued and invested in their work. This can lead to a more engaged and committed workforce.

However, HRD can also have negative aspects. For example, if employees perceive that training and development opportunities are not fairly distributed or are only available to certain groups, this can lead to resentment and demotivation. Additionally, if HRD programs are not aligned with organizational goals or do not effectively address skill gaps, they may not have the intended impact on employee performance.

Overall, HRD is a powerful tool that can drive organizational success. However, it is important to be mindful of potential negative aspects and to continually evaluate and improve HRD programs to ensure they are meeting the needs of both the organization and its employees.",Personal,
Adaptive Immunity: T-Cells and B-Cells,"While the doctor is correct in identifying B-cells’ contribution to fighting the infection, he does not tell the entire story. The B-cells belong to the so-called third line of defense, which activates when the previous ones could not contain an infection. However, the role of T-cells is equally relevant during that stage. The two types have different developmental cycles, challenges, and responses, with B-cell triggering the secretion of immunoglobulins and T-cells leading to cell-mediated immunity, but both are extremely important for fighting infections. B-cells are also responsible for maintaining T-cells and suppressing the expansion of the pathogenic types, potentially caused by cytotoxic cells, which could explain why the doctor emphasized B-cells’ importance. However, the potential of various T-cell subcategories should not be underestimated, as some also stimulate B-cells activities and facilitate natural immunity, which will make Bruce eventually recover. Overall, the doctor could have highlighted B-cells’ role in fighting the diseases and regulating T-cells, but both are important, and the latter might be more potent in fighting Bruce’s infection than expected.","Adaptive immunity is a type of immune response that is activated by exposure to specific pathogens or foreign substances. Two key components of adaptive immunity are T-cells and B-cells.

T-cells are produced in the thymus gland and play a crucial role in cell-mediated immunity. They recognize and destroy infected or abnormal cells, such as those infected with viruses or cancer cells. There are different types of T-cells, including helper T-cells, cytotoxic T-cells, and regulatory T-cells, each with a specific function in the immune response.

B-cells, on the other hand, are produced in the bone marrow and are involved in humoral immunity. They produce antibodies that recognize and bind to specific antigens, such as those found on bacteria or viruses. This binding marks the pathogen for destruction by other immune cells.

T-cells and B-cells work together to provide a coordinated and effective immune response against specific pathogens. Understanding the role of these cells in the immune system is crucial for the development of effective vaccines and therapies for infectious diseases and other conditions related to the immune system.",Argumentative,
Millennials and Gen Z: Dependence on Technology,"Even though some people may regard the negative assessment of a younger generation that appears in social media feed as faulty, they are partially correct. There is, indeed, a significant generation gap between people who lived in the 1960s and the people entering their twenties today. There also is substantial evidence that people of one generation share similar characteristics since they grow in one social and political environment.

The world has changed since the sixties, and people need more time to grow up due to the economic revolution, the sexual revolution, the women’s movement, and the youth’s movement. Today, people need to prepare themselves for a more complicated life, which makes them postpone their commitment to a family, stable job, or even to a specific geographical location. Therefore, the statement that modern people are more dependent on technology and try to avoid commitment is true, and it is not necessarily a bad thing.","Millennials and Gen Z are often characterized as being dependent on technology. While both generations grew up with access to the internet and digital devices, Gen Z has been more immersed in technology from an earlier age. As a result, they are more likely to use social media, mobile apps, and other digital tools to communicate and interact with the world around them.

However, both generations have also been able to leverage technology to their advantage. They have used it to connect with others, learn new skills, and even launch successful businesses. Technology has also allowed them to be more productive and efficient in their personal and professional lives.

Despite these benefits, there are also concerns about the negative effects of technology on the younger generations. Some studies have suggested that excessive screen time can lead to social isolation, mental health issues, and poor sleep quality.

Overall, while there are some differences in the level of dependence on technology between Millennials and Gen Z, both generations have grown up in a digital age and have been shaped by the technologies available to them.",Argumentative,
Researching of Issue of Immigration,"Immigrants are people who voluntarily move to another country, state, or region permanently. A community psychologist may face significant challenges when working with immigrants due to the loss of their culture, values, and support systems. Thus, when addressing the problems of immigration, community psychologists need to focus on re-establishing support systems, which may include helping to find a church group or a club for immigrants to join. This can help the people transfer their positive experience to 
Immigration is a widely discussed issue due to the growing number of immigrants around the globe. Community psychology can help the global community to acquire a deeper understanding of the problems of immigrants by moving beyond the individual-level problems to the community level. Inclusion of this level helps to appreciate local policies and attitudes that can affect the immigrants and improve their quality of life.
","Immigration is a complex issue that has been the subject of extensive research in recent years. The debate surrounding immigration is often fueled by political, economic, and social factors, with proponents and opponents of immigration presenting different arguments for and against it.

Research on immigration has shown that it can have both positive and negative impacts on the host country. On the one hand, immigration can bring economic benefits, such as a more diverse workforce and increased innovation. On the other hand, it can lead to social and economic challenges, such as strain on public services and increased competition for jobs.

In addition to the economic and social impacts of immigration, research has also examined the legal and ethical dimensions of immigration policies. For example, some argue that certain immigration policies can violate human rights or lead to discrimination against certain groups.

Overall, the research on immigration highlights the need for a comprehensive and balanced approach to immigration policy that takes into account its various impacts and complexities. This requires collaboration between policymakers, researchers, and civil society to develop policies that are both effective and ethical.",Expository,
Causes of Increased Healthcare Cost in the US,"The United States have experienced a great rise of medication costs in recent years. There are very many factors that have led to the rise of medication costs in the United States. Some of the factors include the rising cost of Medicaid and Medicare government programs that have increased the demand of medical services in the US. The increased demand results in to the increase in price of medication products and services. The outbreak of the covid 19 pandemic has also contributed to the rise of medication cost. This is because more resources are used in the managing of the covid 19 patients making people with other ailments to spend more in order to get the medical services. Increased cases of chronic illnesses such as diabetes in the US plays a major role in increasing the cost of medication as much finance is put in containing and treating people with the chronic diseases.
","The cost of healthcare in the US has been a persistent issue affecting millions of Americans. There are several factors that contribute to this problem. One of the major causes is the lack of price transparency in the healthcare industry. Patients are often unable to compare prices for medical procedures, drugs, or hospital stays, leading to overcharging and inflated healthcare costs.

Another cause is the complex nature of the US healthcare system, which is heavily influenced by private insurance companies and pharmaceutical corporations. This has resulted in a system that is fragmented and difficult to navigate, with varying costs for services depending on the individual's insurance plan.

Additionally, the high demand for healthcare services has also contributed to the high cost of healthcare in the US. The healthcare system is often overburdened, leading to longer wait times for patients and higher costs for healthcare providers.

Addressing the high cost of healthcare in the US will require a comprehensive approach that involves policymakers, healthcare providers, and patients. A transparent pricing system, better regulation of insurance companies and pharmaceutical corporations, and efforts to improve the efficiency of the healthcare system could help reduce costs and improve access to quality healthcare for all Americans.",Expository,
