Nature versus Nurture and Learning among Children,"The debate on the impact of heredity and environment on the growth and development of human beings has been going on for a long period of time now. Researchers have traced this ageless debate to as long a time ago as the 13th century. This implies that human beings, particularly researchers are yet to reach a consensus on the significance of nature and nurture on human development.

Those who support the role of nature in human development argue that all behaviour is dictated by genetic or hereditary predispositions that are encoded from the time of conception. The proponents of the role of nurture in the development of human behaviour emphasise the role of environment in which they are brought up in.

The essay seeks to explore the nature versus nurture debate in relation to the provision of appropriate learning experiences for children. It will then conclude that much of a child’s learning is influenced by both environmental as well as heredity factors.

Psychological researchers have been engaged in an unending debate on whether a child’s development is directly influenced by heredity and other biological factors or it is by the environment in which the child is born and raised. Both sides have advanced undisputable evidence to support their respective sides.

Of much concern among modern researchers is the determination of the degree of influence of nature and nurture on the development of a child and the provision of learning experiences. We shall focus on the impact of both sides of the debate on the child’s learning.

The advocates of the nature theory of human behaviour argue that a child is born with inherent genetic traits that play a central role when it comes to the general development of the child.

They propose that nature provides the child with the necessary capabilities and capacities required for meaningful learning. According to Gopnik, a renowned professor of psychology, it is by nature that a child is able to learn and influence the environment and interact with it as well.

She argues strongly against the proposal by John Locke who said that a child is born with a blank mind known as “tabula rasa” on which experiences write on it. Some of the qualities that have been identified as hereditary include; a persons height, behaviour, and intelligence quotient (IQ), among others.

Investigations conducted by nature theorists on twins who were raised in different environments revealed that they could still exhibit notable similarities. The findings further indicated that measures of personality as well as that of temperament, leisure-time and occupational preferences, and attitudes towards social life were much similar among the twins.This study, therefore, supports the argument that nature plays a great role in child development.

To contrast, another study was conducted on adopted children who shared the same family environment but no genetic relationship. The findings revealed very minimal similarities among the children, but significant similarities with their actual parents. This emphasises the role of genetic factors in the growth and development of human persons.

With the revelation of the key role that nature plays in child development, educators are enlightened on the appropriate learning experiences that they should provide to individual children. Understanding the child’s background is therefore crucial in ensuring that the child is exposed to the proper experiences as well as detecting any disabilities that may hinder learning. This knowledge helps teachers and parents in designing appropriate learning experiences for each child early enough.

On the other hand, the role of the environment in shaping human behaviour has received as much support as that of heredity. Scientists have established that the way a child is nurtured can help in determining the child’s general personality/capabilities and behaviour. They have concluded that most behaviours and habits can be learned from the surrounding in which one is brought up.

The diet that a child is given, for instance, has been demonstrated as influencing the development of some capabilities. A study conducted by psychological researchers where some children were given food enriched with vitamins and minerals revealed significant impact of nutrition on intellectual development. The children scored higher on the same nature of intelligence tests that had been given before.

A group of children who had been put on diet which had not been enriched recorded no meaningful improvements on the same intelligence tests. Apart from enhancing intellectual capabilities, the researchers noted that it was logically correct to conclude that nutrition impacts on the physical capabilities as well.

Nurture theorists further illustrate that if a child is brought up among wild animals, the child would never develop normally when eventually brought back to live among human beings.

This argument points to the fact that social behaviour is learned from interaction with other people. For educators, the knowledge of the role of environment in shaping behaviour helps them in developing an environment that is conducive for learning in order to facilitate meaningful development. John Locke, a renowned advocate of the nurture theory regarded a child’s brain as a blank slate where experiences were to be written upon.

This theory also notes that skills like listening, attentiveness, and following instructions are learned from the environment and determines success in school. Hence, educators have realise that a child must be provided with proper experiences that will facilitate the acquisition of crucial qualities that will in turn enhance learning.

The essay has focused on the two sides of the nature/nurture debate and how each plays a role in the development of human behaviour. It is clear that some qualities are inherent in an individual and are independent of environmental influence. On the other hand, some qualities can be enhanced by the exposure of a child to an appropriate environment.

With these considerations in mind, educators must appreciate the role of both genetic as well as environmental factors in child development. Appropriate learning experiences that enhance both of these need to be provided right from childhood.","The debate on nature versus nurture has been a long-standing issue in the field of psychology. The nature side of the argument suggests that genetics and heredity play a significant role in human development, while the nurture side contends that environmental factors such as upbringing, education, and life experiences are crucial determinants. This essay will explore the nature versus nurture debate as it relates to learning among children, discussing key concepts and research findings in the field.

Nature refers to the biological or genetic aspects of human development. Children inherit certain characteristics from their parents, including physical traits, intellectual abilities, and personality traits. The study of genetics has shown that certain traits are determined by genes, which are passed down from one generation to the next. For example, some children are born with a genetic predisposition for a particular disease or condition, while others may be more naturally inclined towards certain sports or activities.

On the other hand, nurture refers to the environmental factors that influence human development. Children are influenced by their surroundings, including their family, friends, teachers, and community. The nurture side of the debate suggests that a child's experiences and upbringing have a significant impact on their learning and development. For example, a child who is raised in a stimulating environment with access to educational resources is more likely to succeed academically than a child who is raised in a deprived environment.

The debate on nature versus nurture and learning among children is complex and multifaceted. While both nature and nurture contribute to a child's learning and development, researchers have attempted to determine the extent to which each factor plays a role.

One area of research that has examined the nature versus nurture debate in learning is intelligence. Intelligence is a complex trait that involves cognitive abilities such as memory, reasoning, and problem-solving. The nature side of the debate suggests that intelligence is largely determined by genetics, while the nurture side suggests that environmental factors such as education and upbringing play a more significant role.

Research in the field of genetics has shown that intelligence is heritable, meaning that some aspects of intelligence are determined by genes. However, environmental factors also play a role in shaping intelligence. Studies have shown that children who are exposed to stimulating environments, such as those with access to educational resources, tend to have higher levels of intelligence than those who are raised in deprived environments.

Another area of research that has examined the nature versus nurture debate in learning is language development. Language is a critical aspect of human development, and the ability to communicate effectively is essential for success in social and academic settings. The nature side of the debate suggests that language development is largely determined by genetics, while the nurture side suggests that environmental factors such as language exposure and education play a more significant role.

Research in the field of linguistics has shown that language development is influenced by both nature and nurture. Children are born with a biological predisposition to learn language, but their language development is also influenced by environmental factors such as language exposure and education. For example, children who are exposed to multiple languages from an early age tend to have better language skills than those who are exposed to only one language.

The debate on nature versus nurture and learning among children also extends to the development of social skills. Social skills are critical for success in social and academic settings, and the ability to interact effectively with others is essential for positive social and emotional development. The nature side of the debate suggests that social skills are largely determined by genetics, while the nurture side suggests that environmental factors such as socialization and education play a more significant role.

Research in the field of psychology has shown that social skills are influenced by both nature and nurture. Children are born with a biological predisposition for social interaction, but their social development is also influenced by environmental factors such as socialization and education. For example, children who are exposed to diverse social situations from an early age tend to develop better social skills than those who are not exposed to such environments.

In conclusion, the debate on nature versus nurture and learning among children is a complex and multifaceted issue. While both nature and nurture contribute to a child's learning and development, research has shown that environmental factors such as upbringing, education, and life experiences play a crucial role in shaping a child's cognitive, linguistic, and social skills. Understanding the interplay between nature and nurture is essential for educators, parents, and policymakers who aim to promote positive outcomes for children's learning and development.

In practice, it is important to create environments that are conducive to learning and development. This includes providing children with access to educational resources, exposing them to diverse social situations, and encouraging their intellectual curiosity. Additionally, it is important to recognize that every child is unique and that individual differences in learning and development can arise from a combination of nature and nurture factors. By embracing this complexity, we can create learning environments that are inclusive and supportive of every child's unique learning needs.

In conclusion, while the debate on nature versus nurture and learning among children may never be fully resolved, it is clear that both nature and nurture play important roles in shaping children's learning and development. By understanding the interplay between these factors, we can create environments that promote positive outcomes for children's learning and development. This includes providing access to educational resources, fostering diversity and inclusivity, and recognizing individual differences in learning needs. Ultimately, by embracing the complexity of the nature versus nurture debate, we can create environments that support children's growth and success.

Supporting Children’s Mental Health,"When a child is growing up, all those who interact with him/her need to be careful by ensuring that the environment that the child interacts with is safe. This includes removing objects that can injure the child in the classroom and the entire compound. These roles of child safety are mostly left to the teacher because he/she is the one who is with the child most often hence should be accountable incase of anything.

When the child reaches the age for going to school, both the teachers and the parents should make adequate preparations to ensure that the child will have a smooth experience at school. This paper focuses on the things that teachers should take in consideration to make sure that the child with mental problems will prosper in academics like the rest of the learners.

Teachers and parents should work together in promoting the wellness of a child because factors such as children’s experiences at home and school greatly influence their mental growth. The child spends most of the time with the teacher while at school, so in this case one expects the two, that is, the child and the teacher to have a strong bondage. The parents should assist the teachers in identifying their child’s strengths and weaknesses because this will assist the teacher in knowing how to deal with every individual child.

Koplow argues that if the parents do not collaborate with the teachers the first few days may be difficult for both the child and the teacher because the teacher is not aware of what to expect and this means that more time will be wasted while the two entities are getting to know each other.

Before the child is taken to school the parents or guardians should explain to the child the things that are to be experienced in school life such as waking up early than usual and the assignments that are to be done everyday. The teacher on the other hand should check to ensure that all the facilities required are in their right place.

Both the teacher and the child’s parents should compare notes so that they can have a common approach in handling such child. This means that the child should feel at home when at school and vice versa. None of the parties should be harsh to the child as this would diminish the trust in the teacher and parents.

The parents should ensure that they provide a peaceful environment back at home because issues like violence and quarrels that take place in the presence of the child are quite traumatizing hence they should not be exposed to the child.

Moreover, if parents interfere with the teacher’s efforts they might make the teacher look like a bad person to the child. This means that if the child is given any form of punishment the parents should appreciate it as the appropriate method of correction rather than criticizing it. Criticism is only acceptable when the approach used in correction is harmful either physically or mentally and if so it should not happen in the presence of the child. Correction should be done with lots of love because anger might cause it to loose its meaning.

Sorte, Daeschel and Amador recommend that while in the classroom the teacher should establish a strong relationship with each individual child. The teacher should exercise patience because it takes time for a child to develop confidence in a stranger. This friendship can be enhanced by being kind to the child by creating sometime for the two that is the child and the teacher to have conversations.

The teacher should take time to listen to what the child is pointing out and should use an appropriate approach while correcting the child because wrong approach could be interpreted as hatred by the child and this may cause the child not to be frank with the teacher.

During learning sessions the teacher should be very patient because all children do not have the same understanding, there are those that are fast learners and those that are slow learners but whatever the case all of them should be treated evenly. However, those that have special needs should be handled differently. This includes equipping them with learning aids which will enhance their learning to make sure they excel like the rest.

The teacher should encourage good behavior in a child by rewarding the child for outstanding behavior or action. The parents should also create some time for their children because providing for their physical needs is not enough. Children are like adults hence they also need someone to talk to when they feel things are not going in the right direction. This time that is spent between the child and the parents/teachers is important because it provides the teachers and guardians with an opportunity to monitor the progress of the child.

When children are out in the playground the teacher should monitor the games they play because they can injure each other. In addition, harmful objects like sharp objects should be out of reach to the children. The children should be taught to play creative games.

This means that other facilities should comply with standard safety measures such as having electricity properly insulated without any hanging wires. This is because children like exploring their environment and such things might cause physical body harm and even death. The same safety precautions should be observed by parents at home.

The teacher should encourage children to develop friendships among themselves because this contributes to their social well being. In essence, this friendship makes the child feel like school is part of family because he/she has a strong sense of belonging. Children become brighter when they mingle with each other in their plays, which is quite important for their mental and physical well being. When they learn to appreciate each other it boosts their self esteem.","Children's mental health is a critical component of their overall well-being, as it affects their ability to learn, develop relationships, and cope with the challenges of life. As such, it is essential to support and promote children's mental health through various means, including education, advocacy, and early intervention. In this essay, we will discuss the importance of supporting children's mental health, explore some common mental health issues affecting children, and identify strategies and resources for promoting children's mental health.

Mental health problems can have a significant impact on children's lives, affecting their academic performance, social skills, and relationships with peers and family members. Children with mental health problems may experience difficulties concentrating, managing their emotions, and communicating their thoughts and feelings effectively. These difficulties can result in poor academic performance, strained relationships with others, and an increased risk of mental health problems in adulthood.

Supporting children's mental health can help them develop coping skills and resilience, which are essential for managing the challenges of life. When children receive early intervention and support for mental health issues, they are more likely to experience positive outcomes and lead productive and fulfilling lives. Moreover, promoting mental health can help reduce the stigma associated with mental health problems, encouraging children and families to seek help when needed.

Several mental health issues can affect children, including anxiety, depression, ADHD, and behavior disorders. Anxiety is one of the most common mental health issues affecting children, with approximately one in five children experiencing anxiety at some point in their lives. Anxiety can manifest in various ways, including excessive worry, fear, and avoidance behaviors. Children with anxiety may experience physical symptoms, such as stomachaches, headaches, and trouble sleeping.

Depression is another common mental health issue affecting children, with an estimated one in ten children experiencing depression. Depression can affect children's mood, energy, and motivation, causing them to withdraw from activities they once enjoyed. Children with depression may experience feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and worthlessness, which can affect their ability to function in school and at home.

ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects approximately 5-10% of children. Children with ADHD may experience difficulties with attention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, affecting their ability to focus, complete tasks, and regulate their behavior. ADHD can affect children's academic performance, social skills, and relationships with peers and family members.

Behavior disorders are another common mental health issue affecting children. Children with behavior disorders may exhibit disruptive or aggressive behaviors, such as temper tantrums, defiance, and physical aggression. Behavior disorders can affect children's ability to function in social settings, leading to academic problems, social isolation, and strained relationships with family members.

Several strategies and resources can be used to promote children's mental health, including education, early intervention, and community resources. Education can help parents, caregivers, and educators recognize the signs of mental health problems and provide appropriate support and intervention. Educational programs can be delivered in schools, community centers, and healthcare facilities, providing information on mental health issues and strategies for promoting mental health.

Early intervention is critical for promoting children's mental health, as it can prevent mental health problems from becoming more severe and affecting children's development and well-being. Early intervention can involve counseling, therapy, medication, and other treatments, depending on the child's needs and the severity of the mental health problem. Early intervention can be provided by mental health professionals, pediatricians, and other healthcare providers.

Community resources can also play a critical role in promoting children's mental health, providing support, and early intervention. Schools, healthcare providers, community centers, and mental health organizations can all provide services and resources to support children's mental health. Schools, for example, can offer counseling services, mental health education programs, and support groups for students. Healthcare providers can provide mental health screenings and referrals to mental health specialists. Community centers and mental health organizations can offer support groups, therapy, and other resources for children and families.

Another important aspect of supporting children's mental health is to promote resilience. Resilience is the ability to cope with and adapt to difficult situations, and it is a key factor in promoting good mental health. Children who are resilient are better able to bounce back from stress and adversity and are more likely to have positive mental health outcomes.

There are several ways to promote resilience in children. One way is to encourage them to develop positive relationships with adults and peers. Children who feel connected to others and have a sense of belonging are more likely to be resilient. Parents and caregivers can also help children develop problem-solving skills and a positive outlook by modeling healthy coping strategies and providing support when needed.

Additionally, it is important to address the impact of social media and technology on children's mental health. While these platforms can provide many benefits, such as social connection and access to resources, they can also have negative effects on mental health, such as cyberbullying and social comparison. Parents and caregivers can support children's mental health by teaching them responsible technology use and modeling healthy boundaries around screen time.

Lastly, it is essential to promote early identification and intervention for mental health issues in children. This can involve educating parents, caregivers, and teachers about the signs of mental health problems and providing access to mental health resources, such as counseling and therapy. By identifying and addressing mental health issues early, children can receive the support they need to thrive.

In conclusion, supporting children's mental health is essential for their overall well-being and success in life. This can be achieved through creating supportive environments, promoting resilience, addressing the impact of technology, and promoting early identification and intervention for mental health issues. By prioritizing children's mental health, we can help them reach their full potential and live happy, healthy lives.",Expository,1
Web Communication and Advertising,"The development of online technologies has transformed marketing strategies of many companies; in fact, nowadays it is difficult to find a product that is not advertised via Internet.

However, many organizations still underestimate the benefits offered by the World Wide Web. This paper aims to develop an Internet marketing strategy for such a product as mineral water. It is normally advertised through television, radio, and billboards but online channels are seldom used.
There are several objectives which have to be attained: 1) to raise the customers’ awareness about the product; 2) to allow the customers make online purchase; 3) to increase the customer base of the company. This internet advertisement will target two types of clients:
Individual customers who may be willing to learn more about different companies selling mineral water.
Private companies: restaurants, hotels, snack bars, fast food chains that will make wholesale purchase.
At this point we can discuss several aspects of online advertising and their importance. One of them is direct e-mail. We are going to use in order to inform our returned customers, most likely, they will be wholesalers, restaurants, hotels about new products, benefits and discounts. It is also necessary to compile a list of prospective companies that may require this kind of product and send them newsletters.
One should note that customers should be contacted via e-mail no more than two times per month; otherwise these mails can be regarded as spam. The major benefit of this approach is that it enables the company to raise awareness about the products and about other offerings. Additionally, direct e-mail enables companies to maintain long-term relations with returned customers.
Cross-media advertising is another aspect of Internet advertisement that one should utilize. Overall, this approach can be regarded as combined use of television, radio, print and video. The distributers of mineral water can successfully adopt this strategy with the help of Internet since nowadays there are many online radio stations or online newspapers; furthermore, one should not forget about online television.
Additionally, there are also many video-sharing websites where companies can post their commercials. The producers of mineral water can promote their products through each of these media. Cross-media advertisement is important for the attraction of new customers. By adopting this approach, the companies can reach a wide target audience.
The companies, which produce and sell mineral water, can also rely on banner advertising. These banners should be placed at the websites of online newspapers and Internet forums. The banners should emphasize some distinguishing properties of the product such as the benefits for health of the consumers, its taste and certainly the price.
In this case, the main objective of this strategy is to attract the customer’s attention to the product. Furthermore, the banners must provide links to the website of the company. It will be particularly relevant for private companies that may be searching for the information about different producers of mineral water.
In this way, they will be able to make online wholesale purchases. Banner advertising is important to that extent that it serves different purposes at a time: first, it enables the company to increase people awareness about the company and most importantly form the customers’ initial perception of the product.
Prior to launching an Internet marketing campaign, the company should accurately determine the target market. As it has been mentioned before, the producers of mineral water should address the needs of individual clients and profit organizations like restaurants, hotels. The potential consumers of this product can be of different age, sex, income level, values or occupation. Therefore, one should not give preference to only one type of websites.
Thus, the advertisements should be placed at forums, social networks, web directories, website of different newspapers, etc. The identification of target market is crucial for a company because one has to understand the purchasing habits of the customers. The key advantage of Internet marketing is that it can allow us to target different groups of customers, depending on their age or occupation.
We need to mention some other elements of an Internet marketing strategy; they are public relations (PR) and promotions.
The manufacturers of mineral water should maintain their public image by providing information about themselves at their websites. They need to focus on such issues the technology that they use, the quality standards, health benefits that they offer to the customers.
In the age corporate social responsibility PR management can play the most crucial role. Its purpose is to ensure that customers take positive attitude to the firm. PR campaign has to convince them that the company cares not only about profit-making but also about the community.
At the beginners companies producing mineral water should choose above the line promotion which means that they need to pay a specific agency (online newspaper, forum, social network, video-sharing website) for the placement of the commercial.
At this particular stage, they need to attract the customers’ attention to the brand. The selection of promotion strategy is crucial for the formation of brand identity; in other words, they aim to make the name of the company as well as its products recognizable.
The enterprises which intend to sell mineral water have to conduct Internet marketing research. In particular it is necessary to conduct survey among the customers and ask them about those qualities which they value most in this type of product or why they select a specific product among many others.
Secondly, it is vital to learn what kind of websites they regularly visit. Internet marketing research can shape the outcome of a marketing campaign because it will give the company insights into the values and habits of customers.
Finally, one has to speak about the search engine registration. The producers of mineral waters create official websites that would be accessible through different search engines like Google, Yahoo, AltaVista, MSN etc. Search engine can improve the visibility of the company and its products. This is why one should not disregard them.
Therefore, in this paper we have demonstrate how producers of mineral water can benefit from Internet marketing and its various aspects. The key advantage of this approach is that it allows to target a wide audience. Moreover, it is less expensive than traditional marketing.

Assistive Technology for Kids with Learning Disabilities,"Assistive technology for kids with learning disabilities refers to the mechanism of employing tools, devices and equipments to aid, compensate or act as a remedial measure for those children with learning deficiencies.

Assistive technology neither cures the learning deficits nor does it eliminate them, but rather, it aids the kid in harnessing her full potential.

As such, the child can integrate inherent abilities to the learning process-as assistive technology offers an avenue of bypassing challenging portions of the learning activity. Thus, assistive technology cushions challenged children by compensating for the learning deficits of the kid.

For instance, arithmetic assistive technology tools are developed to aid those kids who are challenged in carrying out mathematical operations. This arithmetic handicap in kids can be observed in those children who strive to compute, organize, align and note down mathematical statements with very little success.

Thus, in designing both visual and audio aids, assistive technology offers the much needed help to children in carrying out mathematical manipulations and operations.

An electronic math worksheet is one good example of an arithmetic assistive technology tool- it aids arithmetically challenged children organize, align, compute and manipulate mathematical functions on a computer monitor.

The electronic math worksheet is equipped with various in-built systems offering user friendly services; for instance, it has an inherent speech synthesizer which audibly articulates both numerical and functional operations after processing.

As such, the audible feedback does not only bring the arithmetically challenged children to be at par with their counterparts but it also motivates the learner by boosting their confidence in ensuring that the resultant answers are accurate.

The use of electronic math worksheet as an assistive technological tool is mainly targeted to third, fourth, fifth graders through to middle school students.

This follows from the fact that some threshold arithmetic maturity is indispensable for effective utilization of electronic math worksheets.

Moreover, electronic math worksheets are needed only in those mathematical manipulations which bear some substantive complexity to the arithmetic age of the child.

Since there is an influx of new electronic math worksheet designs, it is essential that one should endeavor to buy the most appropriate type of electronic math worksheet for the children who are arithmetically challenged.

Such factors as the needs and deficits of the kid, the kid’s abilities, the collection of electronic math worksheets in the market and the setting under which it would be used should be put into consideration as one selects the type of math worksheet which would best aid the kid.

When once such factors are considered, one needs to establish the quality, usability, and the reliability of the electronic math worksheet before settling to purchasing it.

It is advisable to purchase a portable electronic math worksheet for a kid, since children need to carry them and use them in various settings (school, home and in social interactions). A pocket-sized mobile electronic math worksheet may prove to be of a comparable effectiveness as one integrated in a computer system.

An electronic math worksheet is effective if it fulfills the function for which it was designed, and thus it should be user friendly and easy to operate, clear visual display and makes audible sound projections, compatible with other related technologies, reliable and long-lasting.

Instructional technology refers to the integration of the current technological innovations in the teaching and learning process, it is basically employed by the tutor, to aid in the process of instruction and thus foster comprehension on the part of the learners.

The prevailing global technological proficiency demands that teachers should embrace instructional technology in their teaching programs and educational institutions to ensure that media- and internet –savvy graduates enter the job market.

Frame routine is one such instructional technology which is primarily developed to help learners organize topics, key principles, and guidelines on class assignments. Frame routine is strategically engineered into a hierarchical graphic presentation (frame) that aids the learners in connecting, correlating and associating related information.

The use of frame routines in an instructional setting does not only direct the learner’s attention to specific ideas but it also allows the learner to view supplementary details in the due process of studying. In implementing frame routines, the logical presentation of frame graphics enhances the comprehension, the internalization and ultimately the understanding on the subject matter of the content.

The compatibility of frame routines welcomes the integration of a variety of related multi-media programs into the system and hence covers a broad spectrum of disciplines.

The flexibility of frame routines serves an indispensable role in structuring special learning programs for learners with learning disabilities.An increasing number of educators are incorporating frame routines to the web platform, in which a constant touch with both students and parents is maintained. This noble technological endowment has simplified the instructional process in that teacher can now post class assignments, upload additional instructional materials, and highlight important academic dates.

The association of frame routines with the web has also provided an open forum to all stakeholders of the educational institution, under which due correspondence is assured from the administration front, through the lecturer, to the learner or even the parent.

The effectiveness of a frame routine can be gauged on the scales of its associated impact on the teaching methodologies and strategies of an instructor and the resultant impact on learners’ understanding.

Therefore, teachers need to develop a comprehensive plan stipulating the boundaries of applying frame routines; be it on examinations, grading, and research purposes.

In this view, therefore, there arises an imperative necessity for in-service training for teachers in the technological front of designing and using frame routines. Such a move does acquaint teachers with the requisite technological knowledge which is essential for tentative association of frame graphics in a classroom scenario.

Research on optimal utilization of frame routines reveal that teachers ought to make a plan which would ensure that a sustainable and fruitful classroom situation thrives during the instruction process.

The other factor which governs the success of frame routines in a learning situation is the quantity and quality of the hardware at hand. Whereas laptops may serve a splendid purpose in their compatibility to frame routine programs, desktops similarly excel in some tasks.","Children with learning disabilities often face unique challenges in the classroom, making it difficult for them to keep up with their peers. However, assistive technology has been shown to help these children succeed in school and beyond. From text-to-speech programs to speech recognition software, assistive technology can help level the playing field for children with learning disabilities. In this essay, we will explore the various types of assistive technology available for kids with learning disabilities and their benefits.

One of the most common types of assistive technology is text-to-speech software. This type of software allows children to hear the text that they are reading, making it easier for them to understand and retain information. Text-to-speech software can be particularly helpful for children with dyslexia, a learning disability that affects reading ability. For example, a child with dyslexia may have difficulty decoding words and struggle to read fluently. Text-to-speech software can read the words aloud, allowing the child to focus on comprehension rather than struggling with decoding.

Another type of assistive technology that can be helpful for children with learning disabilities is speech recognition software. This type of software allows children to dictate their thoughts and ideas instead of writing them down. For children with dysgraphia, a learning disability that affects writing ability, speech recognition software can be a game-changer. Instead of struggling to write legibly or type quickly, children can simply speak into a microphone and watch as their words appear on the screen.

Graphic organizers are another type of assistive technology that can be helpful for children with learning disabilities. These visual tools can help children organize their thoughts and ideas and make it easier for them to see the connections between different concepts. For example, a child with ADHD may have difficulty staying focused and may struggle to organize their thoughts when writing a research paper. A graphic organizer can help the child break down the research paper into smaller, more manageable tasks, making it easier for them to stay on track.

Assistive technology can also be helpful for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a developmental disorder that affects social interaction and communication skills. For example, some children with ASD may have difficulty with expressive language, making it hard for them to communicate their thoughts and feelings effectively. Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices can help these children express themselves using pictures, symbols, or text-to-speech software.

In addition to these types of assistive technology, there are many other tools and devices that can be helpful for children with learning disabilities. For example, electronic spell-checkers can help children with dyslexia or dysgraphia catch spelling errors. Adaptive keyboards and mice can help children with motor disabilities or coordination issues use computers more easily. And specialized software programs can help children with ADHD stay focused and on task.

While assistive technology can be incredibly helpful for children with learning disabilities, it is important to remember that it is just one tool in a larger toolbox of interventions and strategies. For example, while speech recognition software may help a child with dysgraphia write more easily, it does not address the underlying writing difficulties that the child may be experiencing. Similarly, while graphic organizers may help a child with ADHD stay organized, they do not address the underlying attention difficulties that the child may be experiencing.

It is also important to note that assistive technology should be used in conjunction with other types of interventions and support. For example, children with learning disabilities may benefit from individualized education plans (IEPs) or accommodations such as extra time on tests or assignments. They may also benefit from tutoring or specialized instruction in areas where they are struggling.

In conclusion, assistive technology can be incredibly helpful for children with learning disabilities. From text-to-speech software to graphic organizers to AAC devices, these tools can help children with learning disabilities overcome obstacles and achieve academic success. However, it is important to remember that assistive technology is just one piece of the puzzle. It should be used in conjunction with other types of interventions and support, such as individualized education plans, accommodations, tutoring, and specialized instruction.

Parents and teachers should work together to identify the specific needs of each child with a learning disability and determine which types of assistive technology and interventions are best suited for them. This may involve trying out different tools and strategies and monitoring the child's progress over time.

It is also important to involve the child in the process and empower them to take ownership of their learning. Children with learning disabilities may feel frustrated or discouraged at times, but by providing them with the right tools and support, we can help them build confidence and develop the skills they need to succeed.

In addition to academic success, assistive technology can also help children with learning disabilities develop important life skills. For example, speech recognition software can help children with dysgraphia write emails and letters more easily, which can be helpful in personal and professional contexts. AAC devices can help children with ASD communicate with their peers and family members, improving their social skills and quality of life.

Assistive technology can also help children with learning disabilities develop a sense of independence and self-reliance. By giving them the tools they need to succeed in school and beyond, we can help them become more self-confident and self-assured. This can have a positive impact on their overall well-being and quality of life.

In conclusion, assistive technology is a powerful tool for children with learning disabilities. It can help them overcome academic obstacles, develop important life skills, and become more self-reliant and confident. However, it is important to remember that assistive technology is just one piece of the puzzle. It should be used in conjunction with other types of interventions and support, and it should be tailored to the specific needs of each child. By working together, parents, teachers, and children with learning disabilities can achieve academic success and build a brighter future.",Expository,8
Bilingualism and Multilingualism,"Language is the influential aspect which determines the peculiarities of the people’s interactions in society. It is possible to discuss the usage of language for communication from psychological, linguistic, and sociolinguistic perspectives because language plays an enormous role in the formation of human identity.

The peculiar features of the social development influence the progress of the situation when today many people are considered as bilingual or multilingual.

Economical, political, cultural and social shifts to the development of international economy and integration caused the fact that the notions of bilingualism and multilingualism which are closely connected with the phenomenon of globalization became important aspects of a modern society.

To understand the peculiarities of this tendency, it is necessary to examine the definitions of bilingualism and multilingualism and determine the features in which these notions are similar or different.

The issue of defining such notions as bilingualism and multilingualism is widely discussed by many researchers nowadays. The main difference of their approaches is in the consideration of these notions as similar or different in relation to their major characteristics.

In her work, Pavlenko accentuates the fact that traditionally bilingualism and multilingualism are discussed as the same notions that is why she uses use the term ‘bilingualism’ in order to study the aspects of bi- and multilingualism with paying attention only to the number of languages used by a speaker.

According to this idea, bilingualism should be defined as the phenomenon when people use two languages to realize their social interactions, and multilingualism is the phenomenon when people use more than two languages to complete their social needs.

However, to discuss the aspects of bilingualism and multilingualism, it is necessary to focus on the factor of the social motivation and psychological peculiarities of the ability to use two or more languages for interactions. To discuss the notions as the same, it is necessary to state that bi/multilingualism is a complex phenomenon which is influenced by social and psychological factors and also affects the structure of the languages used.

This phenomenon is connected with the notion of codes. Thus, bilingualism is a result of “psycholinguistic functioning of the mind when having two codes”.

Nevertheless, it is also possible to notice that multilingualism is a result of using more than two language codes. The usage of two or more codes results in developing code-mixing and code-switching during the communication process.

The peculiar features of code-mixing and code-switching are widely discussed by those researchers who support the opinion that bilingualism and multilingualism cannot be considered as the same notions. The base for their arguments is two views known as the ‘fractional’ view and ‘holistic’ view.

According to the first perspective, a bilingual is a person who interacts as two monolinguals depending on definite circumstances (Altarriba & Heredia, 2008). The ‘holistic’ view is more general and states that the languages used are interdependent and influence each other. Thus, the person who uses them should be considered as a unique personality following definite sociolinguistic peculiarities.

Focusing on these two views, sociolinguists and psychologists accentuate that code- switching as the selection of definite linguistic elements in languages to use is more typical for bilinguals and code-mixing is more typical for multilingual persons who combine the elements of many languages in one speech to complete the conversation goal.

Moreover, it is significant to pay attention to such points as the types of bi/multilingualism and their differences. Researchers define circumstantial bilingualism as the person’s usage of two languages according to the situation of communication and other socio-environmental factors which influenced the necessity to learn the second language.

Circumstantial multilingualism can develop on the base of previous bilingualism under the definite living circumstances. That is why it is almost impossible to determine any strict differences in these types.

Sequential bilingualism is based on the fact bilinguals develop some proficiency in their native language and then learn the second language. Thus, their knowledge about the native language can influence their acquiring the second language. The next stage after acquiring the second language can be multilingualism when a person studies languages sequentially.

Thus, there are no obvious differences in sequential bilingualism and sequential multilingualism. The only fact which can influence the peculiarities of multilingual persons’ interactions is the ability to learn languages more effectively with using the knowledge about the first two or more languages.

Passive bi/multilingualism is characterized by a person’s knowing two or more languages, but active usage in communication of only one of them (Paradis & Navarro, 2003). Thus, the peculiarities of circumstantial, sequential, and passive bi/multilingualism cannot be considered as decisive for determining the differences in using the notions.

Those researchers who develop the idea that bilingualism and multilingualism are similar notions accentuate the fact of ‘soft boundaries’ between languages which are typical both for bilinguals and multilingual persons.

Nevertheless, the other linguists argue that because of predominantly circumstantial character of bilingualism, ‘soft boundaries’ between languages are more typical for the multilingual practice.

To determine the differences and similarities in the notions of bilingualism and multilingualism, it is possible to provide the general definition which is based on the opinion that a multilingual person differs from a bilingual only in the number of languages he knows. Moreover, multilingualism can also include the concept of bilingualism as the certain type of the phenomenon.

However, according to the ‘holistic’ view with focusing on such aspects as code-mixing and ‘soft boundaries’ between languages, it is possible to define a multilingual person as a man who uses more than two languages for realizing everyday social interactions.

The main peculiarities of multilingual persons is the effective usage of more than two languages as the combination of codes (code-mixing) in order to achieve the goal of communication in spite of environmental factors.

Multilingual persons differ from bilinguals in such aspects as the intensity of interdependence of the languages used, forming a unique personality from the psychological and sociolinguistic perspectives, and the usage of two or more languages and their combinations depending on their effectiveness according to the communicative goal.","Bilingualism and multilingualism refer to the ability to speak and understand two or more languages. The importance of being able to communicate in multiple languages has become increasingly recognized in today's global society. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of bilingualism and multilingualism, including the cognitive, social, and economic advantages, and provide some examples of successful bilingual and multilingual individuals.

Firstly, there is evidence that being bilingual or multilingual can have cognitive benefits. Studies have shown that learning and using multiple languages can improve brain function, enhance memory, and increase attention and concentration skills. Bilingual children have been found to outperform monolingual children in tasks that require cognitive flexibility, problem-solving, and creative thinking. Moreover, bilingualism has been linked to a reduced risk of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults. These findings suggest that bilingualism and multilingualism can contribute to the development and maintenance of cognitive abilities across the lifespan.

Secondly, there are social advantages to being bilingual or multilingual. Speaking more than one language can facilitate communication and promote intercultural understanding. It can also enable individuals to access different cultures and perspectives, and connect with people from different linguistic backgrounds. Bilingual and multilingual individuals may have a greater sense of identity and belonging, as they can communicate with multiple communities and navigate different cultural contexts. In addition, learning multiple languages can foster empathy and appreciation for diversity, which are important values in today's interconnected world.

Thirdly, there are economic benefits to being bilingual or multilingual. The ability to speak multiple languages can open up career opportunities in a globalized workforce. Many international organizations and multinational companies require employees who can communicate with clients and partners in different languages. Bilingual and multilingual individuals may also have a competitive edge in the job market, as they can bring unique perspectives and skills to their work. Furthermore, speaking multiple languages can increase earning potential, as bilingual and multilingual employees may receive higher salaries or bonuses.

There are many examples of successful bilingual and multilingual individuals who have made significant contributions in various fields. For instance, the former Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, is fluent in English, French, and Korean. The Canadian singer-songwriter Celine Dion is fluent in French and English, and has also sung in Spanish, Italian, German, and Japanese. The author J.K. Rowling is proficient in French and has also studied Latin and Ancient Greek. These individuals demonstrate the advantages of bilingualism and multilingualism in different contexts, and how it can enhance one's personal and professional achievements.

Despite the benefits of bilingualism and multilingualism, there are also challenges associated with learning and using multiple languages. One potential issue is language dominance, where one language is used more frequently or valued more highly than another. This can result in the loss of proficiency or motivation to use a less dominant language. Another challenge is language interference, where the structures or vocabulary of one language affect the use of another language. This can lead to errors or confusion in communication. Moreover, some individuals may face social or psychological barriers to learning and using multiple languages, such as discrimination or anxiety. These challenges highlight the need for effective language education and support, as well as recognition of the value of linguistic diversity.

In conclusion, bilingualism and multilingualism have numerous benefits, including cognitive, social, and economic advantages. Learning and using multiple languages can enhance brain function, promote intercultural understanding, and open up career opportunities. Successful bilingual and multilingual individuals demonstrate how linguistic diversity can contribute to personal and professional achievements. However, there are also challenges associated with learning and using multiple languages, such as language dominance and interference, and social or psychological barriers. Addressing these challenges requires effective language education and support, as well as a recognition of the value of linguistic diversity and cultural competence. Encouraging and supporting bilingualism and multilingualism can lead to a more connected and inclusive society that values diversity and promotes intercultural understanding.

Language education and support can start at an early age, with programs such as dual-language immersion and bilingual education. These programs provide students with the opportunity to learn and use two languages simultaneously, promoting cognitive development and cultural competence. In addition, schools and communities can provide resources and support for language learners, such as language classes, cultural events, and language exchange programs.

Employers can also play a role in promoting bilingualism and multilingualism in the workforce. Offering language training and support can help employees develop their language skills and expand their career opportunities. Moreover, companies that value linguistic diversity and cultural competence can benefit from a more inclusive and globally aware workforce.

In conclusion, bilingualism and multilingualism offer numerous benefits for individuals and society as a whole. Learning and using multiple languages can enhance cognitive abilities, promote intercultural understanding, and provide economic opportunities. However, there are also challenges associated with learning and using multiple languages, such as language dominance and interference, and social or psychological barriers. Addressing these challenges requires effective language education and support, as well as recognition of the value of linguistic diversity and cultural competence. By promoting bilingualism and multilingualism, we can create a more connected and inclusive society that values diversity and promotes intercultural understanding.",Expository,
Energy and Environmental Policies,"Laws are meant to regulate how people behave towards each other. The laws are developed by legislatures and thus they are called policies. There are policies which have been put in place to ensure that we don’t destroy our environment.

This is because our livelihood on this planet depends on the environment because if we don’t take good care of it in future we may not be able to obtain our resources from the environment. The policies that were established concerning energy and environment are referred to as energy and environmental policies. This paper focuses on the reasons behind the development of the above policies and the steps that are being taken to implement them.

Energy is very important to us because without it our industries can not operate. The discovery of oil was welcomed with lots of whining and dining and in fact countries that produce oil are fancied by many because their economies are normally stable. The demand for oil is always on the increase every other day because factories are being established daily. In addition, the same oil is used for domestic purposes in form of kerosene and as well as in automobiles.

Morvay and Gvozdenac explains that there are various forms of energy such as wind and chemical, but as for now research has established that energy in form of oil has been causing more harm to the environment than the other forms. This is because when this oil is heated it results in emission of carbon dioxide into the environment which is expressed as pollution because it damages the ozone layer.

Moreover, it leads to acid rain which is very destructive. When the waste from oil is deposited into the environment it endangers our lives because if the toxins come into contact with water bodies our food reserves are at a risk of being extinguished due to the fact that we can no longer eat sea food, neither can we get adequate crop harvests. It is in this regard that governments have come up with policies that aim at safeguarding our environment. The other forms of energy are being utilized because they are least likely to be harmful.

For instance solar energy is very effective and efficient because it does not require any processing and in fact the only thing that is required is storage of this energy. But storage should not be a problem because solar batteries are able to store solar energy which can be used in future. Most government and private entities buildings are being fitted with solar panels that are used as source of electric power.

The energy derived from the sun is easy to convert into electricity because one only needs to use an inverter which converts solar energy into electricity. In fact there are some automobile manufacturers that have already developed a pilot model vehicle that’s powered by solar energy but then they are still working on the project. Another alternative source of energy is wind which is readily available.

There are some governments including the US government that are advocating for this form of energy because its very reliable compared to solar energy. This is because solar energy can not work on rainy weather and cloudy climates. Sperling and Kurani explain that in order to tap wind energy, wind turbines are installed on higher grounds where there is much wind.

Governments have been pushing for the adoption of wind energy because electricity generated from rivers is not reliable because sometimes the water level goes down hence the force of the water is not enough to rotate the turbines.

Additionally, developed countries have been using nuclear energy which is generated very fast compared to the other forms of energy because it’s based on chemical compounds.

Finon and Midtton argue that governments have been holding meetings in a bid to eliminate products that are thought to be harmful to the environment. Of late the manufacture of refrigerators that use CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) has been banned in most countries. In fact people who have the old models are disposing them in exchange of the new models.

Moreover, governments have been against deforestation because the trees are vital in reserving soil nutrients and in addition to that they provide us with oxygen. It is with this regard that governments have been conducting numerous campaigns on tree planting. As of now those who cut trees in order to get timber have to be licensed by the concerned agencies. Governments have been encouraging their citizens to plant more trees as possible.

Furthermore, governments are in support of campaigns against the use of plastic paper bags because they don’t decompose hence they are harmful to the environment. People are being encouraged to develop alternative products that are renewable because if we continue to use our natural resources faster than we can replace them in future we will run out of raw materials.

The campaign for environment conservation has been enhanced by the introduction of paperless transactions which goes along way in reducing the waste that is disposed into the environment. In fact it is illegal to dump waste without appropriate authorization.

In essence, governments have been on the frontline in the battle against waste disposal. Manufacturers are being held responsible for their waste and this means that they must collect the waste after have finished using their commodities.

In some countries like Japan there is hardly any waste that is disposed because they use the same waste to generate fuel and they ensure that the volume of gas that is released into the air is not toxic and thus it does not harm the environment. Implementing effective energy and environmental policies would require political resources, economic ability, major cultural attitudes, and international influence.","Laws are developed to regulate how people behave towards each other.

But storage should not be a problem because solar batteries are able to store solar energy, which can be used in the future. Most government and private entities' buildings are being fitted with solar panels that are used as a source of electric power. The energy derived from the sun is easy to convert into electricity because one only needs to use an inverter, which converts solar energy into electricity. In fact, some automobile manufacturers have already developed a pilot model vehicle that's powered by solar energy, but then they are still working on the project.

Besides, the cost of producing nuclear energy is relatively high compared to other forms of energy. Nonetheless, some countries have been investing in nuclear energy to produce electricity.

Another alternative source of energy that is gaining popularity is geothermal energy. Geothermal energy is generated from the heat that is stored beneath the earth's surface. The heat from the earth's core is utilized to produce electricity. This energy source is sustainable and reliable and has the potential to replace conventional forms of energy. Iceland is an excellent example of a country that has fully embraced geothermal energy. More than 80% of the country's energy is generated from geothermal sources, and the country aims to become carbon-neutral by 2040. In addition, other countries such as Kenya and the Philippines have also invested in geothermal energy. Geothermal energy is an excellent alternative to fossil fuels as it is renewable, abundant, and has little environmental impact.

The use of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydropower, and geothermal energy has been on the rise. Governments worldwide have been supporting renewable energy by providing subsidies to companies that generate electricity from renewable sources. Besides, they have been setting up policies that aim to reduce carbon emissions by using clean energy sources. Such policies include carbon taxes and cap-and-trade programs. Carbon taxes involve imposing taxes on companies that produce high levels of carbon emissions, while cap-and-trade programs limit the amount of carbon that companies can emit into the atmosphere. Such policies have encouraged companies to invest in renewable energy sources, thereby reducing their carbon footprint.

In conclusion, the energy and environmental policies implemented by governments have a significant impact on the environment. The policies aim to reduce carbon emissions and promote the use of clean energy sources. The use of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydropower, and geothermal energy has been on the rise, and more countries are investing in these sources to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels. Governments worldwide have been supporting renewable energy by providing subsidies to companies that generate electricity from renewable sources and setting up policies that aim to reduce carbon emissions by using clean energy sources. By reducing the reliance on fossil fuels and promoting the use of renewable energy, countries can mitigate the effects of climate change and promote sustainable development.",Expository,
Investment in public transport,"Despite its dented public image, public transport remains a better option in the long run. To begin with, public transport helps in environmental conservation through efficiency in energy consumption, reduction in air pollution as well as traffic congestion. Moreover, public transport is cost effective given the efficiency in land use, reduced payments on repairs and insurance of vehicles as well as enhancing safety of the passengers.

On the other hand, private transport has been cited as a means of transport for the middle class due to its expensive nature. Besides, private transport contributes to increased pollution as a result of high consumption of energy and burning of most of world’s fuel. It also increases traffic congestion as well as consuming a lot of space on the streets as well as parking areas. Finally, private transport is cited as unsafe compared to public means.

According to the National Safety Council public transport is about hundred and seventy times safer than private means. However, private transport has been preferred by many people lately due to its reliability, comfort as well as speed and only those who can not afford to buy private cars use public transport. It therefore calls for investment in the public transport to enhance its competitiveness due to the aforementioned long-term benefits. Some of the investment funds should be sourced from taxation of the private transport.

Public transport has proven beneficial to the general public in the long-term compared to the use of private cars in many instances. At the outset, public transport is generally environmentally friendly. The fuel consumption by the public transport is lower hence helps in energy conservation. Consequently, reduction in the world’s petroleum burnt minimizes air pollution. On the other hand, noise levels as well as congestion on the roads are highly reduced.

The latter is attributed to the fact that many people can use fewer buses compared to the many cars needed to transport similar number of passengers. Besides, public transport is more economical compared to the private means. Firstly, it is cost-effective in terms of the auto-maintenance, parking as well the cost of gas. Public transport attracts minimal payments on repairs and insurance.

Additionally, it provides job opportunities to the servicemen hence improving the living standards of many citizens. Furthermore, it helps the business industry through mass transportation of people and luggage. Thirdly, this mode of transport is also efficient in space utilization. Public transport is efficient in land use as it requires minimal parking space in addition to consuming less space on the streets.

There is little doubt that private cars offer comfort, reliability as well as speed to those with high expectations in those areas. Consequently its rise as a preferred means of transport has been witnessed in the recent past and the upward trend is still imminent. According to Simpson only individuals with low expectations would contemplate using public transport compared to private cars.

He argues that private cars offer an extension of home comfort including CD players; stereo as well as radio in addition to flexibility and speed hence many middle class people prefer it to public transport. However, the long term effects of this mode of transport are enormous. To begin with, private cars contribute highly to the degradation of the environment through air as well as noise pollution.

Private cars are cited to be high consumers of energy thereby emitting a lot of smoke given their high number on the streets. Besides, the cars emit carbon dioxide gas that is attributed to global warming. Consequently, air is polluted and such things as acid rains and smog are inevitable. Due to their high numbers on the streets, private cars contribute to traffic congestion in the cities and towns thereby jeopardizing transportation.

Moreover, private cars compromise the safety of passengers. According to Simpson individuals using private cars as a means of transport are nine times likely to die in accidents compared to those using other means such as rail. Besides, Faulks argues that private cars are inefficient in land use as they consume a lot of space for parking as well as in the streets.

He further stresses on the expensiveness of such transport means compared to public transport. Hoogma cites the costs incurred in the repair and maintenance of such private cars as factors contributing to the expensive nature of the mode of transport. Furthermore, payments of insurance, cost of parking, as well as cost of gas are colossal. Job opportunities for the operators are also lost when such mode of transport is adopted.

In a nutshell, private cars have negative effects to the public and natural environment in the long-term despite its comfort compared to public transport. It contributes to environmental degradation, traffic congestion, loss of job opportunities as well as jeopardizing road safety.

However, the public still prefers it to public transport due to the problems facing the latter means of transport. Consequently, a policy that involves taxation of private cars should be implemented to discourage its use as well as preference by the public and instead upgrade the public transport to the efficient and effective levels. The funds accruing from such taxation should be invested in the public transport to elevate it to standards that are competitive to the private mode.

Despite the heightened preference of private cars by the public compared to public transport, investment in the latter is not only viable economically but also safe and environmentally friendly in the long run.

As mentioned above, private transport contributes to environmental degradation; traffic congestion, increased road accidents, as well as loss of job opportunities hence should be discouraged through enactment of suitable policy notably increased taxation.

Such funds should be invested in public transport that has proven beneficial to the public and natural environment in the long-term. For a better and greener future, an investment in an economically and environmentally sound and safe transport mode is fundamental.","Transportation is a crucial element of our daily lives, providing us with the mobility necessary for work, leisure, and social interactions. However, transportation systems also have significant environmental, social, and economic impacts. Private vehicles contribute to air pollution, congestion, and greenhouse gas emissions, while also exacerbating social inequalities by limiting access to transportation for low-income households. To address these issues, there is a growing need for investment in public transport infrastructure as a means of promoting sustainable and equitable mobility. In this essay, I will argue that investing in public transport is essential for creating a more sustainable, equitable, and efficient transportation system.

One of the primary reasons why investment in public transport is crucial is that it can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change. Private vehicles are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for nearly one-third of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. By contrast, public transport systems are far more efficient in terms of emissions per passenger mile. According to the American Public Transportation Association, taking public transport instead of driving can reduce an individual's carbon footprint by up to 30%. Therefore, investment in public transport can play a critical role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, protecting the environment, and mitigating the effects of climate change.

In addition to environmental benefits, investment in public transport can also improve social equity and access to transportation for low-income households. In many cities, private vehicles are the primary mode of transportation, but they are often expensive to operate and maintain, putting them out of reach for many low-income households. By contrast, public transport systems provide affordable and accessible transportation options that can help to bridge the mobility gap for low-income households. According to the National Association of City Transportation Officials, households that use public transport instead of private vehicles can save an average of $9,000 per year. This represents a significant savings for low-income households, which often spend a disproportionate amount of their income on transportation costs. Therefore, investment in public transport can help to reduce social inequalities and provide more equitable access to transportation.

Investment in public transport can also improve the overall efficiency and productivity of transportation systems. Private vehicles are a significant source of congestion and delays, particularly in urban areas where traffic congestion is a major problem. By contrast, public transport systems can move large numbers of people quickly and efficiently, reducing congestion and improving the flow of traffic. In addition, public transport systems can be designed to prioritize high-occupancy vehicles, such as buses and trains, which further reduce congestion and improve overall system efficiency. Therefore, investment in public transport can help to create a more efficient and productive transportation system that benefits all users.

Despite the clear benefits of public transport investment, there are still challenges to overcome. One of the biggest challenges is funding. Public transport systems require significant investment in infrastructure, equipment, and operations, which can be costly. However, the benefits of investment in public transport can outweigh the costs in the long run, particularly when considering the environmental, social, and economic benefits. Therefore, it is essential to prioritize public transport investment as a means of creating a more sustainable, equitable, and efficient transportation system.

Another challenge is political will. Investment in public transport is often a contentious issue, particularly in regions where private vehicle use is deeply ingrained in the culture. There may be resistance from stakeholders who view public transport as a threat to their personal mobility or who are skeptical of the environmental and social benefits. Therefore, it is essential to build public support for public transport investment by highlighting the benefits and addressing concerns. This can involve engaging with stakeholders and community members, providing education and outreach, and demonstrating the benefits through case studies and examples.

Despite these challenges, investment in public transport is crucial for creating sustainable and livable cities. It offers numerous benefits, including reducing traffic congestion, improving air quality, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and promoting social equity. Additionally, it can boost economic growth by providing access to jobs and opportunities.

Therefore, governments must prioritize public transport investment as part of their sustainable development plans. This can involve setting ambitious targets for public transport ridership, increasing funding for public transport infrastructure, and implementing policies that encourage modal shift away from private vehicles. It is also crucial to involve the private sector and civil society in public transport planning and implementation to ensure that investment is aligned with the needs and preferences of the community.

In conclusion, investment in public transport is essential for creating sustainable and livable cities. It can help reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and promote social equity. Despite challenges such as funding constraints, lack of political will, and resistance from stakeholders, governments must prioritize public transport investment as part of their sustainable development plans. By doing so, they can create more accessible, efficient, and equitable transport systems that benefit both the environment and the community.",Argumentative,
Moral issue in business ,"Privacy has been identified to be an integral part of human life. With the high regard that employees hold of their privacy, employers have always found themselves in a dilemma especially where the organizational goals conflict with the privacy of their employees. This is usually the case where the company demands urine tests to ensure the safety of other employees and customers, and also to ensure that employees do not exhibit erratic behavior due to drug use and meet their personal and organizational targets.

Drug tests done by demanding urine samples from employees may sometimes be regarded as an infringement on their privacy. It has been identified that the autonomy that comes with the freedom to divulge information about oneself plays a significant role in employee comfort as well as overall productivity in the organization.

With the introduction of the contract model, there has been some reprieve as employees gain their moral and legal rights, while the employers are then supposed to hold moral and legal obligations to the employees.

The contents of the contract have, however, introduced a new twist to this debate as it is recognized that only information that is relevant to the employer, in regard to the employee fulfilling his or her job requirements, is required. The extent to which employers are restricted from demanding information from employees has been subject to debate as it turns out that the personal information required may vary between different industries.

In this case, the practice of human resource managers exhibits egoism. This is the view that morality coincides with the self-interest of an individual or an organization. The particular rights of the employees seem to fade as the organization seeks to recruit the best employees in the labor market. Though there may be limited requirements on employment, the organization may add more in the course of employment especially when they are in need of downsizing and cannot afford to pay full benefits to all the employees.

The issue of prima-facie obligation is also exhibited. This is where an obligation can be overridden by a more important obligation. In this case, the obligation to ensure that there is as little conflict in the organization as possible so that the managers can comfortably meet their profit margins, may override their obligation to ensure employee autonomy.

On the other hand, where the contractual model is proposed the assumption is that the personal moral and legal rights of the employee will always override those of the employer or the organization. This is also exhibited where individuals may ignore their personal autonomy if it means getting a job that they desire so much, especially where there is more demand for jobs and competition is high.

The consequential theory which determines the moral rightness or wrongness of an action based on the consequences or results of an action can be applied where the productivity of an employee or the profitability of the organization may be at stake.

This means that though the autonomy of the employees may be important, they have to conform to the employer’s demands that may be meant to ensure there is no conflict in the organization or not. This can also be applied where the restrictions in regard to the demands that could be made in a contract, are hard to define.

Utilitarian ethical reasoning has been substituted with egoism in this case. Employers should seek to uphold their employees moral as well as legal rights at all times.

This may at times conflict with their organizational goals, but the ends they desire should not take preference over the personal rights of other people. The extent to which personal rights are considered may vary between organizations, but their application should always be governed by the expressly defined organizational goals.

This is because employees often have prior knowledge of what is required from them when applying to work in a certain organization, and the imposition of additional conditions does not only infringe on their personal rights, but it also contradicts their moral and legal obligations to the organization.

The managers should have thought from a utilitarian point of view as opposed to focusing on selfish means. Employers should not assume that the power they hold, especially where there is more demand for a job, justifies their disapproval of employee autonomy. The contractual model has received some criticism due to the perceived equality that it proposes which doesn’t exist in the labor market.

The fact is, as far as there is a higher demand for jobs than the available supply, employees will often be forced to accept terms that may infringe their personal moral and legal rights. The personal interest of the employer should be synchronized with those of the employees by identifying the conflict areas and exploring their relevance in regard to the organizational goals and the personal goals of all individuals in the organization.

An example is in cases where the nature of the work requires employees to be healthy due to the amount of risk involved, such as flying or operating heavy or risky machinery, it would be advisable to demand for employees medical records and maybe perform medical tests on them. The consent of employees should, however, be sought before such personal information is acquired. This is meant to uphold the employees’ rights and autonomy.

Based on the above analysis, it is evident that the management’s action may result to a detrimental scenario where the workers may feel left out and misused. Should such feelings arise, the workers may end up being less productive as they may fail to own up the entire workplace process. Thus, applying the concept of utilitarianism can adversely help to improve the quality of worker’s productivity.","Businesses operate in an environment that is governed by laws and regulations, but also by moral and ethical principles. Ethical dilemmas arise when a business decision conflicts with moral values, such as honesty, fairness, and responsibility. In recent years, the public has become more aware of the moral issues facing businesses, and there is growing pressure on companies to behave ethically. In this essay, I will explore some of the moral issues that businesses face and analyze the arguments for and against certain practices.

One of the most significant moral issues in business is the treatment of employees. Employers have a responsibility to provide safe and healthy working conditions, fair wages, and benefits to their employees. However, in the pursuit of profit, some companies may cut corners and exploit their employees. This can take the form of long working hours, low wages, and unsafe working conditions. The argument against this practice is that it is morally wrong to exploit employees for profit. Workers have a right to be treated fairly and with dignity, and businesses have a moral obligation to respect those rights.

On the other hand, some argue that businesses have a moral obligation to maximize profits for their shareholders, and that cutting costs by exploiting employees is a necessary part of this. They argue that if a company does not operate efficiently and profitably, it will fail, and all stakeholders will suffer. This argument is flawed, however, because it assumes that profitability and ethical behavior are mutually exclusive. In reality, there are many examples of companies that have succeeded financially while also treating their employees fairly.

Another moral issue facing businesses is their impact on the environment. Companies have a responsibility to minimize their environmental impact, but in practice, many prioritize profit over environmental concerns. This can take the form of pollution, deforestation, and the depletion of natural resources. The argument against this practice is that it is morally wrong to damage the environment for profit. The environment is a shared resource that belongs to all, and businesses have a responsibility to protect it for future generations.

On the other hand, some argue that businesses have a moral obligation to their shareholders to maximize profits, and that environmental concerns should take a back seat to profitability. They argue that environmental regulations are costly and can impede economic growth. However, this argument is short-sighted because it fails to consider the long-term consequences of environmental damage. It is possible for businesses to be profitable while also being environmentally responsible, and in fact, there is evidence to suggest that companies that prioritize environmental sustainability are more successful in the long run.

A third moral issue in business is the treatment of customers. Businesses have a responsibility to provide safe and reliable products and services, to be honest in their advertising, and to protect customers' privacy. However, in the pursuit of profit, some companies may engage in deceptive practices, such as false advertising or the sale of unsafe products. The argument against this practice is that it is morally wrong to deceive customers for profit. Customers have a right to expect honesty and transparency from businesses, and companies have a moral obligation to meet those expectations.

On the other hand, some argue that businesses have a moral obligation to maximize profits for their shareholders, and that deceptive practices are a necessary part of this. They argue that if a company is not competitive and does not attract customers, it will fail, and all stakeholders will suffer. This argument is flawed, however, because it assumes that profitability and ethical behavior are mutually exclusive. In reality, there are many examples of companies that have succeeded financially while also being honest and transparent with their customers.

A fourth moral issue in business is the treatment of suppliers. Businesses have a responsibility to treat their suppliers fairly and ethically. This includes paying them a fair price for their products or services, honoring contracts and agreements, and providing safe working conditions. However, in many cases, businesses prioritize their own profits over their obligations to their suppliers. This can lead to exploitation, particularly in developing countries where suppliers may lack bargaining power. For example, large clothing brands have been criticized for sourcing their products from sweatshops where workers are paid extremely low wages and work in dangerous conditions. Businesses have a responsibility to ensure that their supply chains are ethical and sustainable, and to hold their suppliers accountable for any unethical practices.

In conclusion, moral issues in business are complex and multifaceted, and require careful consideration and attention from all stakeholders. The four moral issues discussed in this essay – employee treatment, customer satisfaction, environmental responsibility, and supplier treatment – are just a few examples of the many ethical challenges that businesses face. To address these issues, businesses must take a proactive and collaborative approach, working with employees, customers, suppliers, and the broader community to identify ethical dilemmas and develop solutions. This involves creating a culture of ethical awareness and accountability, establishing clear policies and guidelines, and investing in training and education. Ultimately, businesses have a responsibility to not only generate profits, but to do so in a way that is sustainable, ethical, and socially responsible.",Analytical,
Arranged Marriage and Its Ethical Dilemma,"The tradition of the arranged marriage has become a controversial issue in the recent years. Can parents decide such an important life choice for their children? What if the children do not have mutual affection? This paper examines the ethics of this scenario based on a dilemma.

Tariq is 17 years old. He is studying to work for a petroleum company. He loves and respects his family but is also afraid of his father, Abdulla. Abdulla is a very strict person who values his reputation above all else. One day, Tariq called his father to arrange a meeting in hopes of discussing an important issue with him. Tariq has not called his family in some time, so his mother Sheikha started feeling like the family is drifting apart. She told this to Abdulla, and he got an idea. To bring his family closer, Abdulla decided to invite all his extended family on the day Tariq was supposed to visit. When Tariq arrived, he was shocked to see his whole family waiting for him. Before Tariq could say anything, his father decided to throw a celebration. During the festivities, Abdulla announced to everyone: “To bring the two our families together I decided to Marry Tariq to Eman, my brother’s daughter!” Eman had feelings for Tariq but could not express them. Unfortunately for her, Tariq already loved another girl and wanted to talk to his father about marrying her. Should he decide to stand up and object to his father, or stay quiet and marry a girl for whom he has no affection? This dilemma concerns all three points of the ethical triangle: The situation, the person, and the norms.

There are two possible courses of action in this dilemma. The first is for Tariq to say nothing and get married to Eman. The second is for him to object to his father and risk angering him and possibly losing the love of his family. Both actions can be analyzed by linking them to the three sides of the triangle.

The situation angle shows there is a chance that he grows to love Eman during their marriage. However, he would have to lose the person he loves right now. His family would be happy to see him married to the person they chose, and his father would save his reputation. However, he could end up in an unhappy marriage with no one being happy.

Analyzing his personal feelings shows how conflicting he is about this decision. He has no affection toward Eman so he would have to struggle to accept this outcome. His love for another woman could lead him to cheat on his wife making the marriage even more stressful. Tariq loves his family and does not want to let them down. His fear of his father would also play into choosing this outcome.

The norms consider arranged marriage a tradition so they would support him choosing to stay quiet. This action would also improve Abdulla’s reputation among the family.

If Tariq chooses to oppose his father, it will make other outcomes possible. Tariq could marry the girl he loves against the will of his father. While it would undoubtedly sour their relationships, it does not guarantee that his family would see it this way.

Personally, it would support his feelings of love, and he might even feel righteous doing it. However, his relationships with his family would be at risk.

The norms would not support this decision because it would break tradition. This action would also negatively affect the reputation of his father.

Care ethics focus on maintaining respectful relationships with people. Going by this theory, Tariq can justify putting his personal feelings aside to save the maximum amount of positive relationships. His family would be happy, Eman could be happy, and his father would feel like he helped bring his family together.

Contractarianism argues that law and social norms are above all. Using this theory, he could justify staying quiet to uphold tradition and not break any social norms.

Empathy ethics dictate that an ethical action should consider the feelings of others. Tariq can justify not saying anything by thinking about his father’s feelings, the feelings of Eman and his family.

Egoism theory states that maximum personal gain makes for an ethical decision. Tariq can choose this theory to disregard any negative outcomes and follow his personal feelings. His relationships will be affected, but he would do what he desires to do.

Consequentialism is a utilitarian theory that before an action is made, the best alternative should be considered. He can justify this action by examining the negatives of a loveless marriage. Arranged marriages often do not have children. Without him, she would be able to find another suitor. Although arranged marriage is a tradition, it is on the decline so that this action would be understood.

Virtue ethics argue ethics argue that an action can be justified based on virtues. Tariq is an honest young man and it would be considered virtuous to say the truth.

Personally, I support objecting in this case. Going by the consequentialism theory, I analyzed the negative of arranged marriages and found that it would likely result in no one being happy.

Such ethical dilemmas are still prevalent in our lives. Every time a young man has to make a decision with severe consequences. Perhaps in the future, we will be able to resolve these issues with better communication.","Arranged marriage has been a longstanding practice in various cultures across the world. It involves parents or family members of the couple finding a suitable partner for their son or daughter. The practice has sparked numerous debates over the years, with some people arguing that it is an outdated practice that violates individual rights, while others see it as a way of preserving cultural traditions. In this essay, I will analyze the ethical dilemmas associated with arranged marriages, including issues of consent, individual autonomy, and cultural relativism.

One of the central ethical issues associated with arranged marriages is the question of consent. Many argue that arranged marriages deny individuals the right to choose who they want to marry, thereby infringing on their fundamental human rights. It is often the case that individuals who are subjected to arranged marriages have little say in the matter, and may even be forced to marry someone they do not love or are not attracted to.

The notion of consent is particularly important in the context of marriage. Marriage is a lifelong commitment that requires mutual love, respect, and trust. In the absence of these factors, a marriage is unlikely to succeed. By denying individuals the right to choose who they want to marry, arranged marriages run the risk of creating unhappy and unfulfilled marriages. This is particularly true for women who are often subjected to arranged marriages without their consent.

However, it is important to note that the issue of consent is not always straightforward. In some cultures, the notion of consent may be viewed differently, and arranged marriages may be seen as a legitimate way of finding a partner. In such cultures, parents or family members may be viewed as having a greater say in the matter, and the desires of the individual may be subordinate to those of the family or community.

Another ethical issue associated with arranged marriages is the question of individual autonomy. Autonomy refers to the individual's right to make decisions about their own lives, free from interference or coercion from others. Arranged marriages can be seen as violating this fundamental principle, as they often involve individuals being forced into marriages against their will.

In many cases, individuals who are subjected to arranged marriages may not have the opportunity to express their desires or make their own choices. This can be particularly true for women, who may be viewed as having less autonomy than men in many cultures. By denying individuals the right to make decisions about their own lives, arranged marriages can be seen as infringing on their individual autonomy.

However, as with the issue of consent, the question of individual autonomy is not always straightforward. In some cultures, the notion of individual autonomy may be viewed differently, and the desires of the individual may be viewed as subordinate to those of the family or community. In such cases, arranged marriages may be seen as a way of preserving cultural traditions and values, rather than as a violation of individual autonomy.

A final ethical issue associated with arranged marriages is the question of cultural relativism. Cultural relativism is the idea that the moral and ethical standards of a society are relative to its cultural context. In other words, what is considered right or wrong in one culture may not be the same in another culture. This can be particularly true when it comes to issues of marriage and family.

Arranged marriages are often seen as a legitimate way of finding a partner in many cultures. In such cultures, the practice is seen as an important way of preserving cultural traditions and values. However, in other cultures, arranged marriages may be viewed as a violation of individual rights and a denial of individual autonomy. This raises the question of whether it is appropriate to impose Western cultural values on other cultures, or whether we should respect cultural diversity and allow individuals to make their own choices.

The practice of arranged marriages raises a number of ethical concerns, particularly in the areas of autonomy, consent, and cultural relativism. While proponents of arranged marriage argue that it is a way to preserve cultural traditions and values, critics argue that it is a violation of individual autonomy and the right to self-determination.

Additionally, the issue of consent is a critical ethical dilemma in arranged marriages, particularly when it comes to forced marriages. In many cases, individuals are coerced into marriages against their will, which can lead to a lifetime of suffering and trauma.

The cultural relativism argument holds that arranged marriages are part of the cultural traditions of some societies and should be respected. However, it is important to recognize that cultural practices should not be used as a justification for unethical behavior, and that universal ethical principles should always take precedence over cultural norms.

It is evident that the practice of arranged marriages is a complex issue with significant ethical implications. While it is important to respect cultural traditions and practices, it is equally important to ensure that individuals are not subjected to coercion or abuse. Therefore, it is essential that individuals have the right to choose their own partners and that their consent is respected.

Moreover, governments and international organizations have a responsibility to protect individuals from forced marriages and other forms of coercion. This can be achieved through legal frameworks, education programs, and support services for individuals who are at risk of forced marriages.

In conclusion, the practice of arranged marriages is a complex ethical issue that raises significant concerns around autonomy, consent, and cultural relativism. While it is important to respect cultural traditions and practices, it is equally important to ensure that individuals are not subjected to coercion or abuse. By recognizing the importance of individual autonomy and consent, and by providing support and protection for individuals at risk of forced marriages, we can work towards a more just and ethical society where individuals are free to choose their own partners and build their own lives.",Argumentative,
Santa Claus and Mythical Creatures,"A mythical creature is a monster that is prominent in myths and folklores. They include mythical beings, basilisks, monsters, cockatrice, hellhound and centaur among others. They are believed to possess some supernatural powers albeit to some extent. The aim of this paper is to study the Santa Claus as an example of one of such mythical creatures.

This is a mythical creature that is believed to deliver gifts to children on the Eve of the Christmas day. It is particularly common with the western cultures specifically in Europe and the U.S. He often wears red attire with cuffs and a collar which is white. In addition, he puts on leathered boots with a black leathered belt.

History of Mythology behind Santa Claus. Santa Claus is believed to have been brought to New York by a Dutch legend called Sinter Klaas during the seventeenth century. A variety of mythical creatures and different legends tell the tale of Santa Claus. The foundation of the association of Santa Claus in Christianity is believed to be Bishop Nicholas in a present day Turkey, formerly known as Smyrna (Izmir).

Bishop Nicholas is believed to live in the 4th century A.D. He had immense wealth and was very lovely, caring and generous towards children. He always threw gifts to poor children as a way of showing them joy. Consequently Saint Nicholas was accorded high esteem by different churches. It was because of his honor that the Orthodox Church, which is the oldest church in Russia, was built.

Within the Catholic Church fraternity, the Saint became the patron of children and seafarers. He was referred to as der Weinachtsmann within the protestant areas in the central and northern Germany. The English people called him Father Christmas. Some Dutch immigrants however took him with them to the United States where he became known as Santa Claus.

Santa Claus drew the curiosity of children who wanted to know what he does and where he lives in between Christmases. Apparently this curiosity led to the conclusion that Santa Claus had a Christmas gift workshop in the North Pole where he lived. But in 1925, it was again discovered that Santa Claus actually lived in Finnish Lapland.

With time, different customs from the Northern Hemisphere joined together and created a global Santa Claus, who was immortal and not affected by either age or time. He wore a red suite and gave gifts to children on the Christmas day before going back to Korvatunturi in Finnish Lapland.

Santa Claus is said to have made several stop over at Napapiiri, near Rovaniemi since the year 1950 to meet children. Due to his now regular visits by 1985, he later established his own Santa Claus office in the same location where he came to daily to listen to children. In addition to his office, there is also a Post Office where he receives letters from children around the world.

Santa Claus is believed to spread happiness and joy during the Christmas celebrations. Santa Claus is also said to be big bellied. This ensures the inexhaustible cheer that he carries around. His big belly also translates into a big heart and hence his generosity. The Santa possesses a white beard made of cotton.

This is translated to mean that he has a lot of wisdom. He always assumes the shape of an old man and owing to the fact that old age ahs always been associated with wisdom, he is believed to be wise too. His red attire is however associated with his roots. Saint Nicholas was a bishop and bishops used to wear red in those days. Therefore the Santa is associated with Godly things.

Santa Claus possesses some similarities with other mythological creatures in various aspects. Some mythological creatures such as the dragon are capable of flying. The same is true with Santa Claus. The mythological creatures also had the ability to perform some weird things that cannot be simply explained. For instance, one could make simultaneous appearances at varied locations at the same time. This is also true with Santa Claus since within the Christmas Eve of twenty four hours, he is supposed to have visited around two billion children.

There also exist number of differences between Santa Claus and other mythical creatures. To begin with, Santa Claus is widely associated with religious practices and events. Other mythical creatures are however related to evil and satanic things. Some, like the dragon, for instance is dreaded and is believed within some faiths to be a demon.

Santa Claus is depicted in the form of a human being while other mythical creatures come in forms of animals or mixtures of different animals or even animals with enjoined in a human being. While Santa Claus is associated with generosity and the availability of gifts, other mythical creatures are associated with destruction and harm.

Santa Claus is believed to have been found by Ak, in the Burzee forest as a baby and placed in the acre of lioness Shiegra. During his teens, Claus was taken by Ak to contact with other mortal lives in a bid of gaining experience on the way they lived. The mortal lives included poverty, war, child abuse, brutality and child neglect. He did not like the experience though. From there he stands doing kind acts to children. This earned him respect and admiration of many till they christen him as a saint and hence the title ‘Santa’.

Many Christians still presume Santa Claus to be an important element in the celebration of Christmas, which they so much cherish. However there are very sharp divides as pertains to his origins. While many Christians hold the view that he is the Saint Nicholas whose love for children and generosity are well known, others consider him as an offspring of the Northern European gods and the spirits who were in existence before the advent of Christianity.

Yet other Christians are vehemently opposed to his involvement in the celebration of the birth of their savior, Jesus Christ. Some even think that his main objective is to commercialize the important day of Christmas. Meanwhile some do not believe that such a creature ever exists.","Santa Claus and mythical creatures have long been an important part of folklore and imagination. These creatures have been passed down from generation to generation, and their stories have evolved over time. From Saint Nicholas to Krampus, from unicorns to dragons, these mythical beings have captured our imaginations and brought joy and wonder to many. In this essay, we will explore the origins and evolution of Santa Claus and several other mythical creatures, and we will examine their enduring appeal.

The legend of Santa Claus has its roots in the story of Saint Nicholas, a Christian bishop from the 4th century who was known for his generosity and kindness. Saint Nicholas became the patron saint of children and was revered for his ability to perform miracles. Over time, his story evolved and was adapted by different cultures and religions.

In the 1820s, the image of Santa Claus as we know him today began to take shape in the United States. The Dutch Sinterklaas tradition was brought over by settlers, and over time, the figure of Saint Nicholas was transformed into a plump, jolly, and bearded man who wore a red suit and delivered gifts to children on Christmas Eve. The modern image of Santa Claus was further popularized in the 20th century through movies, television shows, and advertising.

Despite its commercialization, the story of Santa Claus continues to capture the imaginations of children and adults alike. The idea of a benevolent figure who rewards good behavior and spreads joy and cheer is a comforting one, especially during the holiday season. The tradition of leaving cookies and milk out for Santa Claus, and waking up to find presents under the tree, is a beloved one in many households.

While Santa Claus is known for his kindness and generosity, the Austrian figure of Krampus is his dark counterpart. Krampus is a demonic creature who is said to punish children who have been naughty. In Austrian folklore, Krampus is said to accompany Saint Nicholas on his rounds, and while Saint Nicholas rewards good children with gifts, Krampus punishes bad children by whipping them with birch branches or stuffing them into his sack to take them away.

Krampus has experienced a resurgence in popularity in recent years, particularly in the United States, where celebrations of Krampusnacht, the night of December 5th when Krampus is said to roam the streets, have become increasingly popular. While some see Krampus as a fun and irreverent twist on Christmas traditions, others are uncomfortable with the figure's violent and menacing nature.

Unicorns are mythical creatures that have been depicted in art and literature for centuries. These magical creatures are said to be pure and noble, and they are often associated with femininity and grace. In many stories, unicorns are said to have healing powers and to be able to detect truth and purity.

The enduring appeal of unicorns can be seen in the popularity of merchandise and media featuring the creatures. From stuffed animals and coloring books to movies and TV shows, unicorns continue to capture the imaginations of people of all ages. In recent years, unicorns have also become associated with positivity and self-care, with the phrase ""unicorn magic"" being used to describe a sense of wonder and joy.

Dragons are another mythical creature that have captured the imaginations of people across cultures and throughout history. These powerful and fearsome beasts are often associated with fire, and in many stories, they are said to hoard treasure and kidnap princesses.

Despite their reputation as villains, dragons are often depicted as intelligent and wise creatures who possess knowledge and magic. In some stories, dragons are even depicted as protectors of the natural world, guarding forests and mountains from human intrusion.

In recent years, dragons have experienced a surge in popularity, thanks in part to the popularity of fantasy and science fiction media. From Game of Thrones to How to Train Your Dragon, dragons continue to captivate audiences with their awe-inspiring abilities and complex personalities.

Santa Claus and mythical creatures are a fascinating and enduring part of folklore and imagination. From the benevolent generosity of Saint Nicholas to the menacing punishment of Krampus, these figures capture our imaginations and offer a sense of wonder and joy. Whether we are inspired by the healing powers of unicorns or the fierce power of dragons, these creatures allow us to escape from reality and explore the limitless possibilities of our imaginations.

Despite their fictional nature, these creatures also serve an important purpose in our lives. They offer us a sense of comfort and hope, reminding us that even in the darkest of times, there is always the possibility of magic and wonder. Whether we celebrate Christmas with the image of Santa Claus in our minds or find inspiration in the mythical creatures of our favorite stories, these figures continue to bring joy and fascination to our lives.

In conclusion, Santa Claus and mythical creatures will continue to fascinate us for generations to come. Their stories and legends have evolved over time, adapting to the changing world around us. As we continue to explore the limits of our imaginations, these figures will serve as a source of inspiration and wonder, reminding us that anything is possible in the world of folklore and mythology.",Expository,
Improving the Management Problems Within the Organisation,"Principles of emergency management and the peculiarities of incident management system are crucial for any organisation. Unfortunately, the level of understanding of these principles in our company is rather low. Therefore, I would like to suggest the ways of improving the current situation in the present report. To do so, it is necessary to describe the principles of management, leadership, and command. Next, I shall identify the role of junior managers within the organisation. Finally, I shall characterise the principles of emergency management and the process involved in dealing with emergencies with the use of an incident management system.

The major functions of management are concerned with the following dimensions: planning, controlling, directing, and organising the work within a company. These four functions are the tools employed by a manager with the aim of reaching the organisational purposes. The close relatedness and interdependence of the four constituents necessitate the close attention to their functioning, since a problem with one of the aspects may lead to complications with the rest of them. The major function is planning as it regulates the direction in which a company evolves. Planning is a logical and orderly method of decision making that impacts the company’s development. It incorporates the process of verifying the company’s objectives and choosing the ways of achieving these objectives. Apart from that, planning involves the preparation for the modifications and determination of the possible action pattern. Another peculiarity of planning is that it presupposes the capability to predict the future changes or difficulties and create the opportunities of dealing with them.

Controlling incorporates the strategies employed to make sure that the course of actions does not diverge from the planned schedule. This process involves coming up with the ways of guaranteeing that the expected performance is obtained. Controlling consists of the following features: establishing the standards of work, regulating the approaches for measuring the work standards, and evaluating the employees’ performance with the help of these approaches. Also, controlling presupposes making corrective steps to remove any divergences between the expected and actual performance.

Directing involves several crucial aspects such as leadership, motivation, administration, and communication to make sure that the workers perform their responsibilities in the most productive way. The element of leadership includes giving the instructions and teaching the employees about the policies and approaches. The significance of motivation is explained by its connection to great performance. Administration or supervision enables the manager to obtain progress reports and inform the senior management team about the fulfilment of their directions. Communication should be two-way and free to provide the best transition of the information to the workers and their feedback about it.

Organising necessitates a formal authority format and the management of this authority. Therefore, organising presupposes the establishment of the activities that should be performed to attain the firm’s purposes. The principle of organising is associated with determining the duties, appointing them to the employees, and delineating the necessary level of authority to the employees.

While senior managers bear the responsibility for company’s performance, they resort to help from other members of the managerial team to organise this performance at various levels. Middle and junior managers may have less responsibility than senior managers, but they express a great dedication to their work and have a lot of duties.

Junior managers work under the direct supervision of senior managers, and the major duty of the former is to assist the latter. Junior manager creates a plan for employees’ work and makes sure that each point of this plan is fulfilled. Also, junior managers monitor the progress of the plan and check the work at every stage. Finally, the task of junior manager is to report the outcomes to senior management. To do this, the junior manager makes a comprehensive analysis of the employees’ work and creates a report that illustrates to what extent the workers’ performance corresponds to the plan.

The job of emergency management (EM) department is not seen daily, but the organisation of its work should be extremely efficient so that in case of emergency, it could react promptly and save the lives of employees. EM deals with four types of disasters: man-made, natural, accidental, and deliberate. EM strategy involves four stages that cooperate with each other: “mitigation preparedness, response, and recovery”. The principles of EM are concerned with planning emergency operations, training the employees to fulfil such plans, and maintaining the atmosphere of awareness within the organisation. The major task of EM is to save people’s lives, property, and the environment.

Incident management system (IMS) is built upon two major principles: flexibility and standardisation. The principle of flexibility means that all constituents of IMS are compliant with any case, beginning with minute accidents and up to large-scale disasters. The principle of standardisation presupposes the similarity in preparedness to accidents in different organisations. The effective use of IMS involves five components: preparedness, information management, resource management, command, and continuous management and supply. Preparedness is the most important feature as it allows to be ready for any situation and, as a result, respond to it promptly and minimise the losses. Resources incorporate the equipment, supplies, and employees.

In order to raise the employees’ awareness of understanding the EM principles, it is necessary to organise an educational campaign that would explain the responsibilities of such management and illustrate the adverse outcomes of neglecting the work of such department. By raising the employees’ awareness, we shall encourage them to participate in utilising the incident management system and take care of their own well-being, as well as of health and safety of their colleagues.","Management problems can cause significant issues within an organization, leading to lost revenue, inefficiencies, and dissatisfied customers. These issues can arise from various sources, including a lack of communication, inefficient workflows, and resistance to change. Addressing these problems is critical to an organization's success, as they can impact an organization's bottom line, employee morale, and customer satisfaction. In this essay, we will explore the causes and effects of management problems within organizations and provide some solutions for addressing them.

A lack of communication is one of the most significant causes of management problems. Communication breakdowns can lead to misunderstandings, delays, and mistakes. When employees do not understand their roles and responsibilities, it can lead to inefficiencies and redundancies. Moreover, a lack of communication can also lead to a lack of accountability, as no one knows who is responsible for specific tasks or projects.

To address communication breakdowns, organizations must establish clear lines of communication between departments and employees, providing regular updates on projects and initiatives, and encouraging open and honest communication among team members. This can be achieved by implementing communication tools and platforms that facilitate easy and fast communication, such as Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Zoom. Furthermore, regular meetings or check-ins can help ensure that everyone is on the same page, and any issues or concerns can be addressed in a timely manner.

Another common cause of management problems is an inefficient workflow. Inefficient processes can result in bottlenecks, delays, and errors, which can negatively impact the customer experience. When customer relationships are poorly managed, it can lead to dissatisfied customers, lost revenue, and a damaged reputation. Therefore, it is essential to optimize workflows to ensure that processes are streamlined, efficient, and effective.

To streamline workflows, organizations can start by mapping out current processes to identify inefficiencies and bottlenecks. Once the issues have been identified, standardized processes can be developed and implemented, which are optimized for efficiency and effectiveness. Automation can also be used to eliminate repetitive tasks or processes, which can save time and reduce errors. Providing training to employees on new processes and technologies can also help ensure that everyone is on the same page and can use the new systems effectively.

Resistance to change is another significant cause of management problems. Employees may be resistant to new processes, tools, or technologies, which can impede progress and stifle innovation. This resistance can stem from a variety of sources, including fear of the unknown, lack of training or resources, or a belief that the current way of doing things is ""good enough."" Organizations must overcome this resistance to foster innovation and growth.

To overcome resistance to change, organizations can take several steps. First, they can communicate the benefits of the new processes, tools, or technologies to employees, making it clear how the changes will benefit them personally and how they will contribute to the organization's success. Providing training and resources can also help employees feel more confident and comfortable with the new systems, reducing their resistance to change. Additionally, organizations can incentivize employees to embrace change and innovation, rewarding those who come up with new ideas or solutions.

The effects of management problems can be far-reaching and significant. Inefficient workflows can lead to missed deadlines, lost revenue, and dissatisfied customers. A lack of communication can lead to misunderstandings, errors, and conflicts among employees, which can impact morale and productivity. Resistance to change can lead to missed opportunities for innovation and growth, as well as a lack of engagement and motivation among employees. These issues can erode trust and confidence in the organization, leading to lost customers and revenue.

To address management problems, organizations must first identify the root causes of the issues they are facing. From there, they can develop and implement targeted solutions that address the specific issues they are facing. It is essential to take a holistic approach, involving all stakeholders and departments, to ensure that the solutions are comprehensive and effective.

Another important aspect of addressing management problems is to create a culture of continuous improvement. Organizations should be constantly seeking ways to improve their processes and workflows, listening to feedback from employees and customers, and implementing changes to address any issues that arise. This culture of improvement can help organizations stay agile and responsive, adapting to changing circumstances and staying ahead of the competition.

Finally, it is crucial to have effective leadership in place to address management problems. Leaders must be able to identify and address the root causes of issues, communicate effectively with employees, and implement targeted solutions. They must also be able to motivate and inspire employees, fostering a culture of innovation and continuous improvement. Effective leadership is critical to the success of any organization, particularly in addressing management problems.

In conclusion, management problems can cause significant issues within an organization, impacting revenue, employee morale, and customer satisfaction. A lack of communication, inefficient workflows, and resistance to change are some of the most common causes of these problems. To address these issues, organizations must establish clear lines of communication, streamline workflows, and overcome resistance to change. Creating a culture of continuous improvement and effective leadership is also essential. By taking a holistic approach and implementing targeted solutions, organizations can address management problems and ensure their long-term success.",Expository,
Concepts of the Baroque Era,"The Baroque era was a period in the art history when the Baroque art and architecture prevailed in the European and some of its protectorate’s art world all through the 1600’s to mid 1700’s. This form of art rose primarily because of the protestant reformation struggles that triggered the Catholic Counter Reformation Movement, aimed at averting the spread of Protestantism.

Historically, the period is commonly referred as the common European art style of the Mannerist and the Rococo Eras. The Baroque art had unique stylistic features that included dynamic movements, energy, and unconcealed strong feelings hence, the significance of this form of art all throughout its existence.

Other artistic features that were common in this art include a great sense of space, and realistic reflection of perspective, and realism; features whose main goal was to reflect the inner functioning of the mind and obsession of the human soul. Because of its historical significance in the world of art and contributions to development of the European art, expressions of the Baroque art are prevalent in almost all European nations and most of its colonies.

Considering this, the Baroque Era is one of the most significant periods in the world of art, as it bore a new world of art dominated by both religious and iconoclastic artistic representations, as a result of the new discoveries, and effects of the reformation and counter-reformation campaigns of different religious groups.

With the increasing human conscious about their world in the 17th century, there arose a need for a representational form of art, which could account for the new discoveries and demands that arose in the European society. To accommodate and account for such changes and discoveries, a new and unique form of art rose, as most artists endeavored to represent this new changes and demands in their form of art hence, the rising of the Baroque art.

Three main factors that led to the rise of the Baroque art include the religious struggles that were prevalent among Christian societies, scientific advances, and the growth of powerful absolutist monarchies. As research studies show, although all these factors greatly influenced the rise of Baroque art, the greatest influence came from the then prevalent religious tensions among Christians.

Because of these, religion played a primary role of determining most features of the Baroque art. There were great influences from the Roman Catholic’s Counter Reformation movements of the 17th and 18th century, in its struggle to prevent the spread of protestant faith. Prior to the Protestants’ reformation campaign of 1400’s to 1500’s, the catholic enjoyed the autonomy of controlling the European art world hence, majority of the artistic work were religious representations.

However, with the emergence of the reformation campaign, majority of leaders stated to encourage the inclusion of iconoclastic artistic works. This marked the onset of the Counter-Reformation campaigns to oppose such new emerging ideologies, which had great support from some European prominent leaders.

In its Counter Reformation campaign, the church used emotional, pragmatic, and theatrical art as a methodology of winning the faith of more individuals, leading to the rise of more new Baroque art designs. As time progressed and the struggle heightened, such art designs spread to protestant territories, for example, the Bernini and Rubens hence, leading to the rise of the Baroque art in more European countries and its colonies.

In addition to religion, the many effects of scientific discoveries of the time, for example, the evolution of the press, advances in astronomy, emergence of scientific literature, and economic growth, provided individuals with enough incentives to spend on exotic houses and homes. This greatly promoted the rise of the art as most individuals of the middle and upper class wanted exotic house and home designs to fit their standards.

On the other hand, to represent the new social class of individuals that had emerged, for example, absolutists’ monarchies, calls for formation a new form of art increased, leading to the rise of the Baroque art. As research studies show, the Baroque art was highly representational, had exaggerated decorations, created high sense movement and tension, features that represented the power in these new rising absolutist monarchies.

To win the hearts of more individuals in their Counter Reformation Campaign, the Catholic Church used a form of art that, whose main subject matter was that of grandiose visions, martyrdom, and intense emotion rendering.

Such artistic developments and representations led to the rising of the Baroque art, as the practice became common among painters, and other artisans, for example, sculptors and architects. One primary reason that enabled the Catholic Church to succeed in their endeavor of promoting the spread of the Baroque art is the nature of influence and autonomy it enjoyed over people and the world of art.

Therefore, because of this autonomy, majority of individuals believed representations in most church artistic works hence, greatly influencing the spread of the Baroque art in Europe and its colonies. Generally, the greatest contribution of Counter Reformation to the world of Baroque art was the inclusion of artistic features that could invoke in people deep emotions and strong thoughts, necessary to make them detest the protestant faith.

Although many forms of art characterized the Baroque era, paintings were the most common form of art during this era. Primary characteristics of paintings of this era included rich color, great theater, and the use of intense shadows as the main stylistic features.

The paintings also coined movement with actions, as a means of invoking in its audience strong emotions and excitement, rather than calm rationality. In addition, artists of this era also depicted aspects of naturalism, dynamic movement, and space in their paintings. Generally, most Baroque paintings were a representation of most church related events or figures and historical events.

In conclusion, the Baroque Era is one of the most significant periods in the world of art, because through the many scientific discoveries of the time, and effects of the reformation and counter-reformation, new artistic ideas were born in the world of art.","The Baroque Era is a period of Western art history that spans from the early 17th century to the mid-18th century. It is characterized by a grandeur of form, intricate details, and dramatic expressions that were aimed to elicit strong emotions from the viewer or listener. The term ""baroque"" is derived from the Portuguese word ""barroco,"" which means irregular or misshapen pearl. This essay will explore the concepts of the Baroque Era, including its origins, characteristics, and artistic expressions, and how they shaped the art world for centuries.

The Baroque Era emerged in response to the political and religious turmoil of the 16th century. The Protestant Reformation had shaken the foundations of the Catholic Church, which had been the primary patron of the arts in Europe for centuries. The Counter-Reformation, a movement within the Catholic Church to combat the spread of Protestantism, sought to revitalize the Church's image and appeal to a wider audience. The visual arts played a significant role in this effort, with artists commissioned to create grandiose works that celebrated the Church's power and majesty.

At the same time, the rise of absolute monarchies in Europe brought about a new era of grandeur and extravagance. Monarchs such as Louis XIV of France and Charles II of England used art and architecture to create grandiose palaces and public spaces that reflected their power and wealth. The Baroque style, with its opulent ornamentation and dramatic expressions, was well-suited to this purpose.

The Baroque Era is characterized by several defining features. One of the most notable is the use of ornamentation, which is characterized by an excess of decoration and embellishment. This is evident in the intricate carvings, elaborate moldings, and richly patterned fabrics that were common in Baroque art and architecture. These ornate details were often used to create dramatic contrasts of light and shadow, a technique known as chiaroscuro.

Another defining feature of the Baroque Era is the use of dramatic expressions to convey strong emotions. This is evident in the exaggerated gestures and facial expressions used by Baroque artists, as well as the intense lighting and dynamic compositions that were common in Baroque paintings. This emphasis on emotion and drama was intended to create an immersive experience for the viewer or listener, drawing them into the work of art and eliciting a strong emotional response.

The Baroque Era gave rise to several new artistic expressions that would have a profound impact on the art world for centuries to come. One of the most significant of these was opera, which emerged in Italy in the early 17th century. Opera is a musical form that combines singing, acting, and staging to tell a story. It was a popular form of entertainment among the wealthy and elite, who commissioned elaborate productions that featured intricate sets, sumptuous costumes, and extravagant lighting effects.

Another significant artistic expression of the Baroque Era was the development of the concerto, a musical form that features a solo instrument accompanied by an orchestra. The concerto was pioneered by Italian composer Antonio Vivaldi in the early 18th century and became a popular form of classical music throughout Europe. The concerto allowed for the virtuosic display of a soloist's skills, while also showcasing the technical proficiency of the accompanying orchestra.

Baroque architecture was also a significant artistic expression of the era. Baroque buildings are characterized by their grandeur and ornamentation, as well as their dramatic use of light and shadow. The most notable example of Baroque architecture is the Palace of Versailles in France, which was built by Louis XIV in the late 17th century. The palace features a grandcentral hall, elaborate gardens, and opulent furnishings, all of which were designed to impress and awe visitors.

In addition to these new artistic expressions, Baroque artists also produced many masterpieces in traditional forms such as painting, sculpture, and architecture. One of the most famous Baroque painters was the Italian artist Caravaggio, who is known for his use of dramatic lighting and powerful emotional expressions in his works. His painting ""The Calling of Saint Matthew"" is a prime example of the Baroque style, with its intense chiaroscuro and dynamic composition.

Another significant Baroque artist was the Spanish painter Diego Velázquez, who is known for his masterful use of light and shadow, as well as his ability to capture the personalities and emotions of his subjects. His painting ""Las Meninas"" is widely regarded as one of the greatest paintings in Western art history, and it exemplifies the Baroque emphasis on drama and emotion.

The Baroque Era had a profound impact on the art world, and its legacy can be seen in many of the artistic expressions that followed it. The ornate decoration, dramatic expressions, and immersive experiences of Baroque art and architecture influenced many later artistic movements, including the Rococo, Romanticism, and even contemporary art.

The Baroque Era also played a significant role in the development of music, with many of the forms and structures developed during this period still in use today. The opera, concerto, and sonata forms all have their roots in the Baroque Era, and composers such as Bach, Handel, and Vivaldi remain among the most influential figures in classical music history.

The Baroque Era was a period of great artistic innovation and expression, characterized by its grandeur, ornamentation, and dramatic expressions. Its origins in the political and religious turmoil of the 16th century gave rise to a style that was intended to impress and awe viewers, whether in the form of painting, sculpture, architecture, or music.

The Baroque Era's legacy can be seen in the many artistic movements that followed it, as well as in the enduring popularity of its most famous works. Its influence on music, in particular, remains significant, with many of the forms and structures developed during this period still in use today.

In conclusion, the Baroque Era represents a high point in Western art history, characterized by its opulence, drama, and emotional intensity. Its influence can be seen in many of the artistic expressions that followed it, and it remains a testament to the enduring power of art to captivate and inspire audiences.",Expository,
Inclusive Education’ Benefits,"Nowadays, the US society undergoes the period of cultural expansion, and the fast pace of social diversification raises the topical issue of equality in education. Multiple international education standards and goals emphasize the importance of inclusive school environments in the process of social integration. With this in mind, I would like to talk about a few potential benefits of inclusion.

One of the most significant benefits of inclusion is that it helps culturally, linguistically, and physically diverse students to fulfill their developmental needs more efficiently than isolated education models do. As stated by McGovern, the IDEA requires US public schools to arrange inclusive class contexts to support the learning process of students with disabilities and benefit them academically. Additionally, the research evidence reveals that social interactions experienced by disabled children in inclusive classes positively affect their psycho-emotional state and improve their overall performance. The case study conducted by Staub makes it clear that relationships between disabled and non-disabled children help them to generate more positive emotions, which are usually not observed in restrictive school environments. In this way, inclusion impacts the overall condition of children with disabilities in a favorable way.

Secondly, inclusive settings allow students with special needs and their families to become part of the community. Being involved in a regular classroom can help students with special needs to fit in the society in the future more easily. Inclusion facilitates the development of vital socialization skills, independence, and autonomy in those students. It is especially important during early childhood development because, throughout the period of attending the primary school, students undergo a substantial stage of cognitive, emotional, and psychological development and gain awareness of their social, personal, and academic roles – it is the time when children form competencies needed for future success. Comparing to inclusive environments, non-inclusive classrooms do not provide sufficient opportunities for students to experience life to its full extent. Moreover, it is observed that families having their children in inclusive schools feel more integrated and accepted in their community as they begin to interact more often with other parents whose children attend classes.

Since an inclusive learning environment implies the presence of a drastic difference in students’ abilities and needs, it allows teachers to obtain greater professional experience and achieve a higher level of expertise. Through interaction with diverse students, educators learn about children’s development and raise awareness of their specific needs. The alignment of personal experience and knowledge gained through educator-child interactions helps teachers to arrange instruction practices and activities that are suitable for the skills and psychological states of all students. Understanding children’s needs allow teachers to generate a better sense of diversity and social responsibility and comprehend the significance of their own social role more clearly.

Inclusion teaches nondisabled students to respect diversity, be more compassionate, and responsive. The placement of students with special needs in mainstream classes may favorably impact their peers. One of the case studies reveals that the active involvement of nondisabled students in the process of class management can help to improve the behavior of children with different learning disabilities who may act in an “inconsistent” and unpredictable way at first. In the case of Peter, a student with Down’s syndrome, who was very distracting and even aggressive when he just entered the inclusive class, peer-management stimulated significant enhancement in his behavior.

Other students established a dialog with him and tried and are patient when he acted in an abnormal way. The students thus learned to be more attentive and tolerant. Through active participation in Peter’s learning process and close communication with him, they learned to resolve conflicts and cultivated sensitivity towards the needs of other people. Inclusion provides an opportunity for non-disabled students to obtain a real-life experience of interaction with people who differ from them and develop a greater awareness of the issues associated with social differences, inequality, and inclusion.

Inclusive education plays an essential role in promoting social equality. The school is a vital institution that provides the skills and knowledge needed for the improvement of all spheres of life and support of healthy social practices. The classroom itself represents a micro-social environment in which children learn about commonly accepted values and beliefs, which consequently affect their personal identities, decisions, and actions. Nowadays, when a lot of stereotypes about disability, gender, or race are both explicitly and implicitly promoted via numerous information sources, inclusion may be regarded as core to the achievement of high-quality education for diverse students and the development of more integrated and friendly society.

According to UNICEF, inclusive education does not imply a mere efficient allocation of resources and additional investments but refers to the fundamental shift in values and beliefs on which the current education system is based. When the majority may tend to believe that people with disabilities have a limited capacity in developing skillfulness and knowledge, the inclusive school environment provides them with a chance to achieve their full potential and generate a positive self-image. At the same time, observing a disabled person’s achievement may help to dispel existing stereotypes in other members of the school community. In this way, inclusion may stimulate the acceptance of the fact that any individual can participate in advancing the development of the entire world.

Overall, inclusion has essential meaning because it aims to support diversity and provide disabled, economically disadvantaged individuals, as well as children from minor ethnic and racial groups, with equal opportunities to become well-educated and valuable members of our society. It helps children to develop positive self-identities and improve skills of social interactions. Therefore, we should strive to make our schools more inclusive.","Inclusive education is a type of education system that provides an equal opportunity for all students to learn and develop academically and socially, regardless of their background, ethnicity, culture, gender, race, religion, or disabilities. Inclusive education has gained popularity worldwide as it is believed to have numerous benefits. In this essay, we will discuss the advantages of inclusive education and how it can positively impact students, teachers, and society as a whole.

First and foremost, inclusive education promotes social inclusion and diversity. By including students from diverse backgrounds, inclusive education fosters a culture of acceptance, empathy, and respect for differences. Students learn to appreciate and celebrate diversity, which helps them develop positive attitudes towards individuals who are different from them. This, in turn, helps to reduce stereotypes and prejudices, leading to a more tolerant and cohesive society.

Moreover, inclusive education provides equal opportunities for all students to learn and develop academically, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Students with disabilities are often left out of mainstream education, which limits their chances of achieving their full potential. Inclusive education provides a platform for students with disabilities to receive the support they need to learn and excel in their academic pursuits. This type of education system also helps to remove the stigma associated with disabilities and promotes a more inclusive and accepting society.

Inclusive education also benefits students in various ways. Firstly, it provides students with a sense of belonging and acceptance, which is essential for their social and emotional development. Students who feel valued and included in their school community are more likely to be engaged in their learning and have a positive attitude towards school. Secondly, inclusive education promotes active learning and collaboration among students. Inclusive education encourages students to work together in groups, where they can learn from each other and support each other's learning. This type of collaborative learning helps to develop social skills, communication skills, and problem-solving skills, which are essential for success in the 21st century. Moreover, inclusive education provides opportunities for students to learn from different perspectives, which helps to broaden their knowledge and understanding of the world around them.

Furthermore, inclusive education has been found to improve academic outcomes for students with disabilities. A study conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics found that students with disabilities who are educated in inclusive classrooms perform better academically than those who are educated in separate classrooms. Inclusive education provides students with disabilities with access to the general education curriculum, which is essential for their academic and intellectual development. Inclusive education also provides students with disabilities with the opportunity to learn alongside their peers, which helps to develop their social and communication skills.

Inclusive education also benefits teachers in various ways. Teachers who work in inclusive education are exposed to diverse teaching methods and techniques that they can apply to their teaching practice. They also develop their skills in managing diverse classrooms and individualizing instruction to meet the needs of each student. Moreover, teachers who work in inclusive education report higher levels of job satisfaction as they feel they are making a positive impact on the lives of their students.

Additionally, inclusive education has economic benefits. By providing an equal opportunity for all students to learn and develop their skills, inclusive education creates a workforce that is diverse, skilled, and adaptable. This, in turn, helps to promote economic growth and development. Furthermore, inclusive education helps to reduce the cost of special education services, as more students are integrated into mainstream education, which helps to save government spending.

However, critics of inclusive education argue that it can be challenging to implement and may not be suitable for all students. They argue that some students may require specialized education services that cannot be provided in a mainstream classroom. Moreover, some students may find it difficult to adapt to the pace and demands of a mainstream classroom, which can lead to frustration and a lack of progress in their learning.

While these concerns are valid, they should not be used as an excuse to exclude students from inclusive education. Instead, schools and teachers should strive to provide appropriate support and accommodations to enable all students to participate and succeed in inclusive education. This may involve providing specialized services, such as assistive technology, additional resources, and personalized instruction, to meet the individual needs of each student.

Moreover, it is important to note that inclusive education is not a one-size-fits-all approach. Different students have different learning styles and abilities, and therefore, schools and teachers should adopt a flexible and personalized approach to meet the diverse needs of their students. This may involve providing different levels of support, adapting teaching methods and materials, and creating a safe and inclusive learning environment that fosters the participation and engagement of all students.

In conclusion, inclusive education has numerous benefits for students, teachers, and society as a whole. It promotes social inclusion and diversity, provides equal opportunities for all students to learn and develop academically, fosters collaboration and active learning, improves academic outcomes for students with disabilities, and has economic benefits. While there may be challenges in implementing inclusive education, these should not be used as an excuse to exclude students from this type of education. Instead, schools and teachers should strive to provide appropriate support and accommodations to enable all students to participate and succeed in inclusive education. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive, accepting, and successful society for all.",Argumentative,
Classical Example of a Jerk,"A lot has changed since the appearance of rational beings on our planet, and the introduction of social norms that help people to live together amicably can be numbered among the most significant inventions. Nevertheless, there are people who tend to underestimate the importance of mutual respect and being thoughtful of others. “Jerk” presents the most succinct word that can be used to characterize people like Dale who do not care about other people’s problems caused by their disrespectful attitude to fellow creatures.

What do we know about being a “jerk”? Using the word under consideration in order to express their attitude to some people, individuals tend to mean different things, and this problem must be addressed to come to the right conclusion and define whether Dale can be described as a jerk. Some people think that others are jerks just because their actions and opinions do not meet someone’s expectations. In his work “How to Tell if You’re a Jerk?”, Schwitzgebel discusses the problem, highlighting the importance of jerk self-knowledge. According to the author, this word is not used to denote a stable trait of character as all people have situations in which they act like jerks. The author believes that all people have their own level of “jerkitude”. To him, being a jerk involves being incapable of respecting others’ perspectives and needs.

A jerk is a person who underestimates or does not want to notice the problems that bother other people. The author argues that jerks usually believe that others are nothing more than tools, helping them to achieve success. The researcher draws a parallel between jerkitude, narcissism, and selfishness due to his observations, demonstrating that all people give priority to their own needs from time to time. Taking the definition provided by the author into account, everything about Dale characterizes him as a jerk. People like Dale do not only neglect the needs of people they barely know. Even his partner has to put up with his unwillingness to be as still as a mouse when he is in a bad mood. Dale does not care about people who cannot park their cars as his comfort is the ultimate goal for him. His disrespectful attitude towards other people and their needs makes Dale a real jerk.

Even though the majority of people agree that being a jerk makes any person a dropout who is unable to get along with others, some individuals believe that being a jerk is just in some cases. Trying to support their opinion with evidence, they often talk about their friends or relatives who are so kind-hearted and not prone to conflicts that other people always try to take advantage of their kindness. Jerks often manage to bounce back from any difficult situation, and this is why some of them can see jerkitude as something just. In fact, the accepted definitions of justice run counter to this point of view which is based on the prevalence of self-interest and individualistic perspective. Speaking about the definitions of justice, it is necessary to pay attention to the opinion of Polemarchus in The Republic. This character agrees that justice involves “the repayment of a debt”; when asked about the meaning of this expression, he says that all people should be kind to their friends. At the same time, this “repayment” may involve doing evil to enemies if they deserve it.

To put it in other words, Polemarchus believes that it is just to live in accordance with the principle that involves treating other people as they treat you. This definition of justice proves that being a jerk is unjust. According to it, people disrespect the principles of justice when they do evil to ones who have done nothing bad to them. The case of Dale described in the assignment illustrates injustice, but Dale may think that he is giving credit where credit is due. Being a jerk means being disrespectful to the needs of other people, and the opinion of Polemarchus proves that it has nothing to do with justice. When it comes to the first fact about Dale (cutting in line for the bathroom), such behavior can be caused by Dale’s willingness to settle with people who did the same and caused inconvenience to him. On the one hand, Dale can try “to repay the debt”, but he is not mindful of the fact that his actions cause inconvenience to innocent people. Jerks use other people to achieve their goals, and being a jerk is not just as justice is opposite to the willingness to do harm to people who have done nothing bad to you. Thus, the behavior of Dale presents a good example of injustice.

Another character of The Republic, Thrasymachus, who thrusts himself into the conversation of other philosophers, states that justice “is nothing else than the interest of the stronger”. The character means that only those things that align with the interests of authorities can be called just. The societal order can be listed among the key factors that provide benefit to authorities as it is easier to rule people who live in accordance with accepted norms. Jerks do not respect the rights and the needs of other people. Jerks are unjust in terms of their attitude to their communities. Using benefits that are available to the members of their communities, they give nothing in return which is unjust. From the point of view of the authorities (or “the strongest”), social misconduct is inappropriate as it causes conflicts and can contribute to the destabilization of a regime. The definition also relates to the behavior that Dale demonstrates; he fails to comply with social norms when he jumps in line and displaces his anger on to innocent people.

In conclusion, Dale presents a classical example of a jerk. His actions demonstrate his inability to comply with social norms. From different perspectives that refer to social norms and morality, his behavior is inappropriate and unjust.","The term ""jerk"" is often used to describe a person who displays rude, obnoxious, or unpleasant behavior towards others. While there are many different examples of jerks in everyday life, there are some historical figures who are often cited as classical examples of jerks. In this essay, we will examine one such figure: Emperor Nero.

Nero was a Roman Emperor who reigned from 54 to 68 AD. He is perhaps best known for his cruelty and excess, which earned him a reputation as one of the worst emperors in Roman history. Nero was born into a wealthy and powerful family, and he was groomed for leadership from a young age. However, his upbringing did not prepare him for the challenges of ruling an empire, and he quickly proved to be an incompetent and dangerous leader.

One of Nero's most notorious acts was his persecution of Christians. In 64 AD, a fire broke out in Rome that destroyed much of the city. While the cause of the fire is still unknown, Nero was quick to blame the Christians for the disaster. He ordered that they be rounded up and executed in gruesome ways, such as being burned alive or torn apart by wild animals. The historian Tacitus described Nero's actions in this way:

""[Nero] falsely charged with the guilt, and punished with the most exquisite tortures, the persons commonly called Christians, who were hated for their enormities. Christus, the founder of that name, was put to death as a criminal by Pontius Pilate, procurator of Judea, in the reign of Tiberius, but the pernicious superstition, repressed for a time, broke out again, not only through Judea, where the mischief originated, but through the city of Rome also.""

Nero's persecution of the Christians was not only cruel and unjust, but it was also counterproductive. It only served to further alienate the Christian community and increase their resolve to spread their message. Nero's actions were a clear example of how a person in a position of power can use that power to inflict harm on others without justification.

Another example of Nero's jerk-like behavior was his lavish and extravagant lifestyle. Nero was known for his love of luxury and excess, and he spent enormous sums of money on building projects, parties, and personal indulgences. He built a massive palace for himself called the Domus Aurea, or Golden House, which was said to be so large that it included an artificial lake and a revolving dining room. Nero also staged elaborate theatrical performances, often taking on the lead role himself, which were financed by the state and lasted for days on end.

Nero's extravagant lifestyle was not only a waste of resources but also a source of resentment among the people of Rome. While the elite may have admired Nero's wealth and power, the average citizen likely saw him as a selfish and self-indulgent jerk who cared only for his own pleasure. Nero's actions demonstrate how a person in a position of power can use that power to live a life of luxury and excess while ignoring the needs of others.

In addition to his cruelty and excess, Nero was also known for his incompetence as a leader. He was often absent from Rome, traveling to Greece and other parts of the empire to compete in athletic competitions and pursue his artistic interests. When he was in Rome, he was prone to making impulsive and ill-advised decisions that had serious consequences. For example, he ordered the execution of his own mother and several other members of his family, which earned him widespread condemnation and resentment.

Nero's poor leadership skills were a clear example of how a person in a position of power can use that power to make reckless and dangerous decisions. His actions had serious consequences for the people of Rome, and they ultimately contributed to his downfall. Nero's behavior ultimately led to a revolt against him in 68 AD, and he was forced to flee Rome. He was eventually declared a public enemy by the Senate and committed suicide, ending his reign of terror.

In conclusion, Emperor Nero is a classical example of a jerk due to his cruelty, excess, and incompetence as a leader. His persecution of the Christians, lavish lifestyle, and reckless decisions demonstrate how a person in a position of power can abuse that power and inflict harm on others without justification. Nero's behavior serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of responsible leadership.

It is important to note, however, that the term ""jerk"" is often used in a colloquial sense to describe people who display rude or unpleasant behavior. While Nero's actions were certainly extreme and inexcusable, it is also important to recognize that many people who display jerk-like behavior may not be in positions of power. They may be everyday individuals who lack empathy, consideration for others, or basic social skills. It is important to address jerk-like behavior in all its forms, whether it is exhibited by those in power or those who are not.

In order to address jerk-like behavior, it is important to understand the root causes of such behavior. In many cases, people who display jerk-like behavior may be struggling with personal issues such as stress, anxiety, or insecurity. They may also lack social skills or have difficulty empathizing with others. Addressing these underlying issues can help individuals overcome jerk-like behavior and develop healthier patterns of interaction with others.

Another important aspect of addressing jerk-like behavior is promoting empathy and consideration for others. This can be done through education and socialization. By teaching children and young adults about the importance of empathy and respect for others, we can help to create a society that values kindness and compassion over self-centeredness and rudeness.

In addition, it is important to hold individuals accountable for their actions. When someone displays jerk-like behavior, it is important to address the behavior directly and provide consequences for negative actions. This can help to discourage such behavior in the future and promote a more respectful and considerate society.

In conclusion, while Emperor Nero is a classical example of a jerk due to his extreme cruelty, excess, and incompetence as a leader, it is important to recognize that jerk-like behavior exists in all areas of society. By addressing the root causes of such behavior, promoting empathy and consideration for others, and holding individuals accountable for their actions, we can create a more respectful and compassionate society for all.",Argumentative,
The Development of Modern Astronomy After Copernicus,"The key theory of Copernicus is based on the following fact: as the distance from the Earth and the centre of motion increase, so the period of the planets becomes longer. This paper, however, will attempt four other main contributors, namely, Tycho Brahe (1546-1601), Giordano Bruno (1548-1600), Galileo Galilei (1564-1642), and Johannes Kepler (1571-1630).

Brahes’ major contribution was the measurement of the position of the planets, stars, the Sun and the Moon on a daily basis as well as the records of these measurements. Brahe formed an extraordinarily perfect star catalogue of close to 1000 stars. In addition, he demonstrated that comets actually were beyond the Moon and not within the atmosphere as perceived by many. It was here that he made his overall advancement on the known methods of observation.

Bruno’s contribution was basically made in the existence of an infinite universe. As a matter of fact, he argued that there existed an infinite universe that had a number of other worlds similar to the Earth. He outlined that the Sun was simply not the centre of the universe.

Galileo’s main impact on astronomy was the observation and analysis of the sunspots, the telescopic confirmation of the phases of the Venus and “the discovery of the four largest satellites of Jupiter”.

Keplers’ main contributions covered the laws of planetary motion. Thus, the first law stated that “planets move in eclipses with the sun at one focus.” The second law suggested that “the line joining the sun to a planet sweeps out equal area in equal times”. And the third law highlighted that “the squares of the periodic times are to each other and the cubes of the mean distance”. So, the geocentric view of the universe stayed for quite some time due to the fact that it was seen as a direct attack on the Catholic Church, the bible, philosophic beliefs and on human mental serenity. This point clearly indicates that the scientific research is still in a revolutionary state.

Geography in its efforts to bridge the natural and human sciences acts as a link between the conservational, ecological and environmentalist view and those of the cultural, social and developmental studies. Geography is the study of mankind and its environment that helps us understand the geographical history and the roles it has played in the evolution of mankind and the environment. On the other hand, geography has its weaknesses as it does not clearly spells out the nature of the relationship between the environment and man.

The weather can be defined as a set of atmospheric conditions such as humidity, rainfall and temperature of a particular region at a particular time of measurement. Climate, on the other hand, refers to the average weather condition measured after a certain time period, usually one year. The common event between both weather and climate are the hurricanes, floods, and drought.

Global warming is the rise in the temperature of the Earth’s surface over the last 50 years, while green house effect is the increase in the concentration of green house gasses. Global warming has the following effects: if there is more heat trapped on the Earth, it will become warmer thus changing the weather. Thus, summers become hotter and so do winters.

Pressure gradient force refers to the force that occurs as a result of pressure imbalance acting across the surface. It drastically changes the speed of wind at a particular time. Coriolis effect, on the other hand, is the perceptible deflection of objects moving in a straight direction in relation to the surface of the Earth. Its effects are deflection of the winds and currents in the oceans, its effects on the missiles and planes. However, frictional force is the one opposing the motion of any particular object.

In the northern hemisphere, Coriolis force has the tendency of changing the direction of the wind to the right in an equivalent speed. Hence, the speed of wind determines the rate of change to the right and, as observed, the strength of this force is greater to the poles comparing to the equator. The great differences in precipitation received from place to place is as a result of the following factors:

the changes in salinity of the oceans, i.e. higher salinities of the oceans accompanied by low latitudes as well as the freshening of both the hemisphere at higher latitudes;
precipitation in conjunction with the rivers discharge into the oceans;
the abrupt decline in the net radiation from the Sun which leads to a brief cooling of both the land and the ocean thereby causing a shift in the precipitation.

The humid subtropical climate (Cfa) is a type of climate characterized by humid and hot summers. Its winters are mostly mild with its precipitation coming from mid-latitude cyclones. The Mediterranean climate (Csa), on the other hand, basically receives its rains in the winter seasons from the mid-latitude cyclones. The Mediterranean climate is known for its extreme weather conditions that are hot during the day and cold at night during the summer seasons and extreme chilly and wet weather during the winter seasons However, the similarity between these climate types is that both the Mediterranean and humid subtropical climate experience humid and warm summers coupled with mild winters.

During the formation of El Nino, the trade winds weaken along the equator as the atmospheric pressure rises in the western pacific and falls in the eastern pacific. Thus, the sunlight in tropics is more intense than the one at higher latitudes making the warmest temperatures of the ocean to be near the equator. Air masses over warm tropical waters extract heat and moisture from the ocean, which becomes less dense than the atmospheric air, hence, ascending to the higher altitude areas. This particular process has a number of effects, namely, it develops drought in the surrounding areas while it also imposes heavy rains to the islands of the central pacific.","The development of modern astronomy after Copernicus was characterized by several significant advances that built on his heliocentric model of the solar system. These advances included the discovery of new celestial bodies, the development of new observational tools, and the refinement of existing theories about the motion of the planets.

One of the most important astronomers of the post-Copernican era was Galileo Galilei. Galileo was an Italian astronomer and physicist who made several important discoveries in the field of astronomy. Using a telescope that he had built himself, Galileo was able to observe the moons of Jupiter and the phases of Venus. These observations provided strong evidence in support of Copernicus' heliocentric model, as they showed that not all celestial bodies in the solar system orbited around the Earth.

Another important development in astronomy after Copernicus was the development of the telescope. The telescope was invented by the Dutch optician Hans Lippershey in 1608, and Galileo was one of the first astronomers to use it for observational purposes. The telescope allowed astronomers to observe celestial bodies in much greater detail than had been possible before, and it helped to confirm the heliocentric model of the solar system.

In addition to the discovery of new celestial bodies and the development of new observational tools, the post-Copernican era also saw the refinement of existing theories about the motion of the planets. One of the most important theories in this regard was Johannes Kepler's three laws of planetary motion. Kepler was a German astronomer who worked in the early seventeenth century, and his three laws helped to explain the motion of the planets in a more accurate and precise way than had been possible before.

Kepler's first law stated that the planets move in elliptical orbits around the sun, rather than in perfect circles as had been previously believed. His second law stated that the speed of a planet varies as it moves around its orbit, with the planet moving faster when it is closer to the sun and slower when it is farther away. His third law related the time it takes for a planet to orbit the sun to its distance from the sun. These laws helped to explain the observed motion of the planets more accurately than had been possible before, and they represented a major advance in the field of astronomy.

Another important development in astronomy after Copernicus was the work of Isaac Newton. Newton was an English mathematician and physicist who developed the laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation. These laws helped to explain not only the motion of the planets but also the motion of objects on Earth, and they represented a major advance in the field of physics as well as astronomy.

The law of universal gravitation states that every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force that is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This law helped to explain the observed motions of the planets in a precise and quantitative way, and it represented a major advance in our understanding of the universe.

The development of modern astronomy after Copernicus was also characterized by the work of many other important astronomers and scientists. These included Tycho Brahe, who made many important observations of the planets and stars, and William Herschel, who discovered the planet Uranus and many other celestial bodies. The work of these and other astronomers helped to build on the foundation laid by Copernicus and to advance our understanding of the universe in significant ways.

In conclusion, the development of modern astronomy after Copernicus was characterized by several significant advances that built on his heliocentric model of the solar system. These advances included the discovery of new celestial bodies, the development of new observational tools, and the refinement of existing theories about the motion of the planets. The work of Galileo, Kepler, Newton, and many other astronomers and scientists helped to advance our understanding of the universe and laid the foundation for further discoveries in astronomy and physics.

The discoveries and advancements made in the post-Copernican era also had significant cultural and philosophical impacts. Copernicus' heliocentric model challenged the prevailing belief that the Earth was the center of the universe, and this shift in perspective had implications for the way that people viewed their place in the cosmos. The work of Galileo and other astronomers helped to confirm the heliocentric model and further cemented the idea that the universe was not centered on the Earth.

The development of new observational tools, such as the telescope, also had cultural and philosophical implications. The ability to observe celestial bodies in greater detail challenged prevailing beliefs about the nature of the cosmos and the role of humanity within it. The refinement of existing theories about the motion of the planets, such as Kepler's laws, also had philosophical implications, as it helped to demonstrate the order and predictability of the universe.

In addition to the cultural and philosophical impacts of these discoveries, the advancements made in astronomy after Copernicus also had practical applications. The development of more accurate models of the solar system and the motion of the planets had important implications for navigation and timekeeping. The laws of motion and universal gravitation developed by Newton had broad applications in physics and engineering, and helped to lay the foundation for the industrial revolution.

Overall, the development of modern astronomy after Copernicus represented a significant advance in our understanding of the universe and had broad cultural, philosophical, and practical impacts. The work of Galileo, Kepler, Newton, and many other astronomers and scientists helped to build on the foundation laid by Copernicus and advance our understanding of the cosmos in significant ways. Today, the discoveries and advancements made in the post-Copernican era continue to inform our understanding of the universe and inspire new discoveries in astronomy and physics.",Expository,
Black Americans in the Revolutionary Era,"The American Revolution is typically depicted as a major step in the realization of liberty and freedom for all. When the lives of African-Americans who lived during the time of this important event are considered, however, our view becomes quite complicated. Liberty came about as the American colonists pursued freedom and independence from rule of the English.
The black Americans were not left behind and thus they adopted the attributes of the revolution with undeterred zeal in a bid to win their freedom.
The main objective of revolution was to achieve a society that enjoyed freedom from the oppressive rule and also to enhance equality in the American society. This paper discusses the intricacies of the revolution era and looks into the motivating effect that the revolution had on black Americans.
As it has been mentioned above, the revolution that was characteristic of the revolutionary era was engineered by American patriots, most of whom had black American slaves. The determination that these patriots fought for their freedom from the rule of the English people had to have a long-lasting impact on the black Americans.
This is because the black Americans were the ones facing the most problems prior to this period and thus complaints by the patriots made them realize that they had been oppressed for far too long. They therefore pursued the ethos of the era which were basically attaining freedom and achieving equality in the American society.
This response by the black Americans towards the things that were happening at the time made them fight relentlessly for their freedom and rights which, in turn, has shaped the history of America and enabled America to be the society it is today.
In as much as the colonists were determined to make a difference in the American society, being involved in the war was not easy for them. A good number of them maintained a neutral position during the revolution era.
Two major changes that occurred in America during the stated revolutionary period are establishment of the Afro-American community in America and the provision of the institutions that would help them live free lives. Afro-Americans were also accepted as part and parcel of the American society. The stated facts have been upheld for decades and consequently, the contemporary American society, undoubtedly, exhibits them.
The Black Americans were contrarily interested in their freedom and thus they were ready to trade anything for their freedom. Consequently, they gave support to the armies that were likely to give them freedom from captivity .They realized the importance of supporting the army other than fighting them after fighting in vain for freedom.
This was after the long period of time they had been captives. Through their union with the British army, they were in a position to be defended from slavery hence freed from captivity. Freedom was possible as the British army had the notion that the black Americans had now surrendered to join their camp.
Another way through which the African- Americans could seek freedom was by being servants for a short period of time thereafter being set free. The service included working for the Britain without remuneration but in the end set free after the term.
At other times they could only get freedom dues which included basic commodities like food, clothing and homes or land.
The worst was when other slaves were meant to serve a lifetime even leading to passage of the slavery down the family tree such that slaves could be inherited and their siblings continue being slaves.
The issue of Racism greatly influenced slavery during the American Revolutionary period. This issue was therefore eliminated through the use of the rhetoric of the revolution by the African- Americans. By this the black slaves were considered inferior but not to be put into slavery. Rhetoric meant the use of suggestive signs other than one on one conversation to indirectly voice out their issues.
The rhetoric of the revolution also emphasized on the fact that the Black Americans were supposed to be pitied and sympathized with. It is also through the use of the rhetoric that the slaves were able to achieve the freedom from being denied the chance to access certain social and public amenities. They were now able to get education, medical facilities, and job opportunities within the country as well democratic rights in their country.
A good example of the rhetoric of the revolution was the use of fighting words. These words were aimed at passing their message or claim to the leaders of the country. The words also played a great part in uniting the people of the nation including the slaves. The slaves also used newspapers to publish their opinions as well as express their grievances. The antislavery campaign through newspapers proved successful as it paved way to peaceful discussions which ended slavery.


Despite the fact that the African- Americans suffered a great deal during this period, there were some benefits that came as a result of the American Revolution.
The major benefit of the American Revolution was the freedom and liberty it brought to the Africans. The African- Americans during slavery were able to work together in unison so as to concur the British army. This taught them how to be self-protective.
They were also privileged to learn several positive things from their colonialists which would help them develop their own nation after slavery. However, a keen look at the occurrence of events during the revolutionary period depicts that the British attained more privileges as compared to the African- Americans.
On the other hand this revolution came with its own disadvantages which include high taxation rates imposed so that the government could generate enough money to pay the large number of army it had acquired.
It also led to the decline in the economic development of their country hence making them dependant on aid. This was the case as they were not able to produce for their own country and instead worked for their colonists.
From the above discussion, it can be concluded that the American Revolutionary era was an important phase of the global history. Its occurrence taught many lessons to the people of the world.
Indeed, it brought about many changes as mentioned above which were rather of great importance. However, the greatest of all was the freedom of the African- Americans that lastly came after a great tug of war. This freedom is what is enjoyed up to this time whereby the Blacks are now independent in their own country.
This was the end of slavery and oppression. The aforementioned benefits of the American Revolutionary also support the fact that it was necessary for it to occur. The mentioned demerits are also important if looked at on the other side of the coin. It was thus a good lesson for both races since equality was in the long run achieved.




","The Revolutionary Era, spanning from the 1760s to the 1780s, was a period of significant political and social change in American history. During this time, the colonists in North America rebelled against British rule, leading to the establishment of the United States of America. The Revolution brought forth many challenges for the country, including debates on issues of race, slavery, and equality. For Black Americans, the Revolution was a time of both hope and disappointment. This essay will explore the experiences of Black Americans during the Revolutionary Era and the impact that the Revolution had on their lives.
At the beginning of the Revolutionary Era, slavery was a widespread practice in the American colonies. African slaves were brought to North America as early as 1619 and were subjected to harsh and dehumanizing conditions. By the 1760s, slavery had become an entrenched system in the American South, where slaves comprised a significant portion of the labor force. Black Americans faced many challenges, including restricted movement, limited access to education, and the constant threat of violence.
Despite these challenges, Black Americans played a significant role in the Revolutionary Era. Many Black Americans fought in the Continental Army, hoping that their service would lead to greater freedom and equality. However, the realities of the war were often disappointing. Black soldiers were frequently subjected to discrimination and mistreatment by their white counterparts. They were often relegated to non-combat roles, such as digging trenches or building fortifications. Additionally, Black soldiers were paid less than white soldiers and were often denied the same provisions and benefits.
One notable example of Black Americans' contributions to the Revolutionary War was the 1st Rhode Island Regiment. The regiment was composed entirely of Black soldiers, and they played a crucial role in several battles, including the Battle of Newport and the Battle of Yorktown. Despite their bravery and sacrifice, the members of the 1st Rhode Island Regiment faced discrimination and mistreatment from their white colleagues. In 1778, a white officer threatened to resign if the Black soldiers were not removed from the regiment. The officers eventually agreed to discharge the Black soldiers, denying them the chance to fight in the final battles of the Revolutionary War.


While Black Americans fought for the patriots' cause, many also saw an opportunity for greater freedom and equality. In 1775, Lord Dunmore, the Royal Governor of Virginia, issued a proclamation offering freedom to any enslaved person who joined the British army. Thousands of enslaved people took up the offer and fled to British lines, hoping to gain their freedom. Despite the British army's promise, however, many Black Americans found themselves enslaved once again after the war's end. Nevertheless, the British promise of freedom provided a glimmer of hope for Black Americans, and it inspired many to continue fighting for their rights.
The Revolutionary Era also saw the emergence of Black activism and advocacy. One of the most notable figures in this movement was Phillis Wheatley, a slave who became a renowned poet. Wheatley's work challenged the prevailing stereotypes about Black people, and she used her platform to advocate for abolition and equal rights. In 1773, Wheatley published a poem in honor of George Washington, who she viewed as a champion of liberty and freedom. While some white Americans saw Black people as inferior, Wheatley's poetry demonstrated the intellectual and creative abilities of Black Americans.
Despite the challenges and setbacks, Black Americans' contributions to the Revolutionary Era laid the foundation for future movements for equality and justice. The Revolution's ideals of freedom, liberty, and equality resonated with Black Americans, who used them to challenge the existing systems of oppression. While the Revolution did not lead to immediate freedom or equality for Black Americans, it created the conditions for future progress.
To summarize, the Revolutionary Era was a period of immense transformation, during which Black Americans played an integral role in shaping the country's future. Despite facing systemic discrimination, mistreatment, and the brutal realities of slavery, Black Americans demonstrated remarkable resilience, fortitude, and courage in fighting for their rights and freedoms. Whether on the battlefield or through advocacy and activism, Black Americans made significant contributions to the Revolution and laid the groundwork for future progress towards equality.
Although the Revolution did not immediately lead to an end to slavery or full equality for Black Americans, it represented a crucial turning point in American history. The Revolution's ideals of liberty, democracy, and self-determination inspired generations of Black activists and advocates to fight for their rights and freedoms, both during and after the Revolution. Furthermore, the Revolution contributed to the growing abolitionist movement, which ultimately led to the abolition of slavery in the United States.
The contributions and sacrifices of Black Americans during the Revolutionary Era continue to serve as a powerful reminder of the importance of fighting for justice and equality, even in the face of adversity. Black Americans' resilience, courage, and determination in the face of systemic oppression and discrimination paved the way for future generations to fight for their rights and freedoms. Today, we must continue to honor and celebrate the legacies of Black Americans who fought for justice and equality during the Revolutionary Era, while also recognizing the ongoing struggle for racial justice in the United States.

Eastern and Western Cultures Difference,"Collectivist tendencies in eastern societies characterize interactions amongst eastern cultures and this makes them quite separate from their western counterparts who are individualistic in nature. The story illustrates this clearly through the narrator who represents the western culture as he has stayed in California for a long time and his father who represents the eastern culture.

Western cultures tend to focus on the individual and a specific person’s needs yet the reverse occurs in eastern cultures. Most easterners will think about how their action will affect their family. For instance, they will think about whether their actions will bring shame upon their families or will bestow honor upon them. In the book, such values can clearly be seen when the narrator’s father talks about their acquaintance who had committed suicide. Instead of narrating the incident as it was, the father opted to focus only on the fact that Watanabe was an honorable man. He knew that if he started passing judgment on him then he would defame Watanabe’s family-which was an issue that is just not acceptable in the Eastern culture.

Gender relations in western cultures are also very distinct from those ones in the eastern part of the world. This is seen by assigned roles within the family and their ability to voice their concerns or communicate directly with members of the opposite sex. For instance, when the narrator interacts with his eastern father from the first time after leaving the airport, he says, “In fact, as I sat opposite him that afternoon, a boyhood memory came back to me of the time he had struck me several times around the head for ‘chattering like an old woman’.” Men in the eastern culture are not expected to talk much and this explains why the narrator has such a hard time getting along with his father because he is just from a western state where men and women have more or less equal chances in communication.

Strict gender roles can also be seen when father and son wait for the only female in the house – Kikuko – to come and cook for them (Isighuro, 494). Furthermore, Kikuko has to wait for the moment when she is away from her father before she can light her cigarette or even talk freely to her brother thus illustrating that women in eastern cultures are expected to be submissive and proper; an issue that hardly crops up in western cultures. Women in the latter community can freely mingle and interact with their male counterparts as was seen when Kikuko started chatting openly when her father left. She also lit her cigarette when she was away from her traditional eastern father.

Western cultures tend to save face in a different way. If one finds himself or herself in some sort of trouble, one is likely to debate over the issue and give his or her opinion openly. Easterners save face in a different way. They tend to avoid confrontation by keeping their opinions to themselves. This aspect was easily seen in the book when father and son are talking about their dead neighbor Watanabe-San who had taken the lives of his family members and his as well.

The narrator clearly had a different opinion concerning the death of the family members as seen when he was told about the incident by his sister. However, when he confronts his traditional Asian father, he soon finds out that his father believed that the deaths were a mistake. The narrator chooses not to say a word because as is evident, their culture does not propagate the freedom to easily voice one’s opinion.

Easterners also revere authority and one is often discouraged from challenging members in high authority. On the other hand, western cultures do not place so much precedence on this matter. The status quo can be challenged if it has been found to be inconsistent. In the story, Kikuko illustrates this when she tells the narrator about her mother’s opinion of him. She asserts that her mother often blamed herself for letting her son become what he was. To them, their son was a rebel of sorts because he chose to oppose the authority of his father. “She used to tell me how much more careful they’d been with me, and that’s why I was so good.”

Westerners tend to encourage direct communication characterized through the use of concrete language. Minimal emphasis is given to non verbal cues as individuals will tend to express themselves well through language. On the other hand, eastern cultures tend to discourage such kinds of expression and normally prefer using indirect communications. For example, instead of explicitly saying no, most individuals will choose to give a neutral answer or circumvent the issue..

For example, when the narrator was asked by his father whether he wanted to go back to the US, he quickly said that he was not sure. Their preference for indirect communication can also be seen in various parts of the story as well. For example, his father is visibly lonely after the death of his wife and the departure of his daughter to university. He therefore needs some company in his life and in order to do so, he needed to get his son to come back home.

Instead of telling him directly, he starts talking about how big the house is now and how it is so difficult for one to live in a house with those many rooms. His son is supposed to get this hint and then take on this new responsibility. However, the western and eastern cultural differences come out at this point when his son fails to recognize the meaning behind his father’s assertions and instead chooses to postpone the matter of his resident ship to the future.

The world is becoming increasingly global and more easterners are interacting with westerners but their sharp differences in communication, conflict avoidance and power distance can still be visibly seen in these scenarios.","Culture is the shared values, beliefs, customs, behaviors, and artifacts that characterize a group or society. It shapes the way people perceive the world, communicate, and interact with others. Culture is not static but rather evolves over time, influenced by various factors such as history, religion, politics, and economics. In this essay, we will explore the differences and similarities between Eastern and Western cultures.

The Western culture is primarily associated with Europe and North America, while the Eastern culture refers to Asia and the Middle East. The two regions have different historical, religious, and philosophical backgrounds that have shaped their unique cultural identities. Despite these differences, there are also many similarities between Eastern and Western cultures, particularly in terms of their shared human values and aspirations.

The Western culture has its roots in ancient Greece and Rome, where ideas such as democracy, individualism, and humanism were developed. The Renaissance period of the 14th to 17th centuries marked a significant cultural awakening in Europe, which saw the rise of art, literature, science, and philosophy. This period led to the emergence of the Enlightenment movement in the 18th century, which emphasized reason, liberty, and progress.

In contrast, Eastern culture has a long history dating back to ancient civilizations such as China, India, and Persia. These civilizations developed complex social, economic, and political systems that were characterized by strong religious and philosophical beliefs. Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism are the major philosophical and religious traditions in Eastern culture, which have greatly influenced the way people think, behave, and interact with others.

Religion and philosophy are fundamental aspects of both Eastern and Western cultures. In the Western culture, Christianity is the predominant religion, which emphasizes the belief in a single God and the salvation of the soul through Jesus Christ. The Judeo-Christian tradition has also influenced Western moral values and ethical principles, such as the Ten Commandments.

On the other hand, Eastern religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism emphasize the interconnectedness of all things and the pursuit of inner peace and enlightenment. These religions are characterized by practices such as meditation, yoga, and mindfulness, which are becoming increasingly popular in the Western world as well.

Culture shapes people's values and attitudes towards various aspects of life such as family, education, work, and social relationships. In the Western culture, individualism is highly valued, which emphasizes personal autonomy, achievement, and self-expression. This has led to a strong emphasis on individual rights, democracy, and capitalism.

In contrast, Eastern cultures emphasize collectivism, which emphasizes the importance of the group or community over the individual. This is reflected in the strong emphasis on family values, social harmony, and loyalty to one's community or country. This has led to the development of more hierarchical and authoritarian political systems in many Eastern countries.

Communication is a critical aspect of culture, which influences the way people express themselves, listen to others, and interpret messages. In the Western culture, direct communication is highly valued, which emphasizes the importance of being clear, concise, and assertive. People are expected to speak up for themselves and express their opinions freely.

In contrast, Eastern cultures emphasize indirect communication, which places more emphasis on context, nonverbal cues, and the feelings of others. People are expected to be more polite, respectful, and deferential to authority figures. This can sometimes lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations between people from different cultures.

Art and literature are important expressions of culture, which reflect people's values, beliefs, and aspirations. In the Western culture, art is often characterized by realism, individualism, and innovation. Western literature, particularly from the Renaissance period onwards, emphasized the importance of individual expression, experimentation, and imagination. Famous Western authors include Shakespeare, Dante, and Tolstoy, and famous artists include Michelangelo, Van Gogh, and Picasso.

In contrast, Eastern art and literature are often characterized by a strong emphasis on tradition, symbolism, and spirituality. Chinese calligraphy, Japanese woodblock prints, and Indian miniature paintings are just a few examples of the rich artistic traditions in Eastern culture. Eastern literature, particularly from ancient China and India, is characterized by a strong emphasis on moral and ethical values, such as the Tao Te Ching and the Bhagavad Gita.

Food and cuisine are an important aspect of culture, reflecting people's tastes, preferences, and traditions. In the Western culture, cuisine is often characterized by variety, innovation, and convenience. Fast food, snacks, and packaged foods are popular choices for busy people on the go. However, traditional Western cuisine is also famous for its rich flavors and hearty dishes, such as Italian pasta, French cuisine, and British pub food.

In contrast, Eastern cuisine is often characterized by its variety, complexity, and health benefits. Rice, noodles, and dumplings are staples in many Eastern diets, along with a variety of fresh vegetables and herbs. Chinese, Indian, and Japanese cuisine are just a few examples of the rich culinary traditions in Eastern culture, which have gained popularity all over the world.

In conclusion, Eastern and Western cultures have many differences and similarities that reflect their unique historical, religious, and philosophical backgrounds. However, despite these differences, there are also many shared human values and aspirations that unite people from all cultures. Understanding and appreciating these differences and similarities is essential for promoting cross-cultural understanding and communication, particularly in our increasingly interconnected and diverse world.",Compare & Contrast,
Kirkstall Precision Engineering: Material Requirement Planning System Report,"Kirkstall Precision Engineering is currently using a material requirement planning (MRP) system, Access FactoryMaster. The business has implemented the MRP system to improve its inventory management and quality control. In particular, the organization relies on barcode scanners to ensure that material management is accurate, up to date, and paperless (Kirkstall Precision Engineering, 2020). The MRP system also allows the business to use Gantt charts to create and manage schedules. Kirkstall Precision Engineering (2020) expects to save more than £20,000 and achieve a 20% turnover growth with the help of Access FactoryMaster. Thus, it is challenging to overestimate the significance of this MRP system for the business.

It is worth admitting that MRP systems typically offer significant advantages, and many scholarly studies prove it. For example, the article by dos Santos et al. (2020) shows that positive effects include reducing information processing time, achieving higher reliability of calculations, meeting delivery times, and others. Simultaneously, MRP systems also allow businesses to reduce waste and improve strategic planning (Akintokunbo & Obom, 2021). That is why one can conclude that these systems contribute to improved work performance.

When it comes to MRP processing, specific inputs, outputs, and processes are involved. The inputs are typically the master production schedule, bill of materials, and inventory status file. All these documents and data are entered into the system that analyzes and processes them. After that, specific outputs are presented, including planned orders receipts, planned order releases, rescheduling notices, cancelation notices, and others. This information demonstrates that MRP systems refer to comprehensive information management processes.

The executive brief has demonstrated that a material requirement planning system is a significant element for a business. This phenomenon results in significant advantages, including reduced information processing time, decreased waste, improved strategic planning, and others. Sufficient evidence demonstrates that Kirkstall Precision Engineering essentially benefits from its Access FactoryMaster, which represents a real-life example of how a material requirement planning system improves business operations. That is why organizations should use this approach to achieve many benefits.","Kirkstall Precision Engineering (KPE) is a well-known company in the manufacturing industry, providing high-quality and high-precision components for a variety of industries. As the company continues to grow and expand, it is critical to have an efficient and reliable Material Requirement Planning (MRP) system in place. In this report, we will discuss KPE's current MRP system, its limitations, and provide recommendations to improve its effectiveness.

KPE's current MRP system is primarily spreadsheet-based, with information on inventory levels, lead times for procurement and production, and finished goods all included in the spreadsheet. The production team is responsible for updating the spreadsheet manually, and a designated individual performs the MRP calculations using separate software.

MRP II is an advanced version of the MRP system that takes into account several factors beyond just materials planning. By integrating various elements of the manufacturing process such as production planning, scheduling, capacity utilization, and financial planning, MRP II enables companies to make informed decisions about resource allocation and utilization. This can lead to improved production efficiency, reduced lead times, and better overall management of the manufacturing process.

One of the most significant challenges of KPE's current MRP system is its reliance on manual input and calculations. As a result, it is prone to errors and inconsistencies, leading to production delays and inventory inaccuracies. The system does not provide real-time updates on inventory levels or procurement status, making it difficult for the team to respond quickly to changes in demand or supply.

In addition to the recommendations outlined above, KPE can also consider the use of demand forecasting tools to predict future demand for its products. By analyzing historical sales data and other relevant factors such as market trends and seasonal fluctuations, demand forecasting tools can provide accurate estimates of future demand. This can help KPE to better plan its production schedules, manage inventory levels, and optimize resource utilization.

It is important to note that implementing a new MRP system can be a significant undertaking and requires careful planning and execution. KPE will need to consider factors such as system compatibility, data migration, user training, and ongoing maintenance and support. It may be beneficial to engage the services of a third-party vendor or consultant with expertise in MRP systems to help with the implementation process.

Another benefit of implementing an integrated MRP system is the ability to create accurate and detailed production schedules. By incorporating data on lead times for procurement and production, inventory levels, and resource availability, the system can generate a production schedule that takes into account all relevant factors. This can help to minimize production delays and ensure that finished goods are available when needed.

To address these limitations, we recommend that KPE implements an integrated MRP system that can automate many of the processes currently performed manually. This could involve the use of a dedicated MRP software package that can integrate with the company's existing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system.

By integrating the MRP system with the ERP system, KPE would have access to real-time data on inventory levels, production schedules, and procurement status. This would enable the company to respond quickly to changes in demand or supply and make more informed decisions about procurement and production.


Another recommendation is to implement a barcode scanning system to improve the accuracy of data input and reduce errors. Barcodes can be used to track raw materials and finished goods throughout the production process, from receipt to final assembly. This would provide real-time updates on inventory levels and eliminate the need for manual data entry, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors.

Moreover, KPE can explore the possibility of adopting advanced MRP techniques like MRP II, which can further enhance the effectiveness of the system. MRP II (Manufacturing Resource Planning) is an extension of MRP, which includes planning and scheduling for resources like manpower, machines, and materials, as well as financial planning. This would help KPE to make more informed decisions about capacity utilization, production scheduling, and overall resource management.

Finally, we recommend that KPE conduct regular reviews of its MRP system to identify areas for improvement and ensure that it remains effective in meeting the company's changing needs. This could involve conducting periodic audits of inventory levels, lead times, and production schedules to identify areas where adjustments may be needed.

In conclusion, KPE's current MRP system has several limitations that can impact the company's ability to manage its procurement and inventory effectively. By implementing an integrated MRP system that automates many of the processes currently performed manually and incorporates real-time data updates, KPE can improve its efficiency and responsiveness to changes in demand or supply. Additionally, the use of a barcode scanning system and exploring advanced MRP techniques like MRP II can help reduce errors and improve accuracy in data input while optimizing resource utilization. Regular reviews of the MRP system can ensure that it remains effective in meeting the company's changing needs. Adopting these recommendations can provide KPE with a more efficient and effective MRP system, allowing the company to continue to grow and expand in the manufacturing industry.  implementing an integrated MRP system is a crucial step for KPE in improving its inventory management and production efficiency. By automating many of the processes currently performed manually, incorporating real-time data updates, and exploring advanced MRP techniques such as MRP II, KPE can improve its responsiveness to changes in demand or supply and optimize its resource utilization. Additionally, the use of barcodes and demand forecasting tools can further enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the system. While implementing a new MRP system can be a complex undertaking, the benefits of improved efficiency and accuracy in inventory management and production scheduling make it a worthwhile investment for KPE.",Expository,
American Health Care System,"Health care is one of the most hectic issues that the United States has had to deal with for so many years. The leadership of the country has been under pressure in the recent years to try to establish a permanent solution to the health care problem. The country’s population is expanding and aging at the same on a daily basis. This population has been increasingly demanding inexpensive medical services to help it remain healthy.
To develop health care systems in the United States, its leaders should emulate other countries that have succeeded in the sector. The People’s Republic of China is one of those countries that have well-developed health care systems that adequately cater for the medical needs of their citizens. China, in particular, has a nationalized health care system that is controlled entirely by the government.
Although most Americans do not support the plan to adopt the Chinese health care system for fear that it may be manipulated by the government, the system offers a better solution to the health care problem in the U.S. If the Chinese system cannot be approved fully, at least it should be implemented partially.
Nevertheless, finding the best solution to the United States’ health care problem requires more than just adopting health care systems of other countries. Americans need a comprehensive and effective health care scheme that can solve their “present and future medical needs”.
The American health care system has evolved through several stages in many years. It can be traced from as far as mid 1700s when the earliest life insurance scheme was established in the country. However, proper health insurance plans came to existence in the 1850s, when Massachusetts, through the Franklin Health Assurance Company, began to offer accident insurance to its citizens.
The accident insurance scheme catered for injuries that were incurred as a result of steamboat transport hitches and railroad accidents. It was after the initiation of the Franklin Company that several plans emerged, which covered all the common types of injuries and sicknesses.
However, the main medical insurance schemes in America were established too late. The medical schemes were established from 1930 onwards. There are a number of reasons that prevented an early invention of the medical plans. One of the major reasons is “the poor quality of the health care that was offered at the time”.
The quality was so poor that the majority of Americans shunned hospitals terming them as unreliable. The schemes offered at the time were only meant to compensate the sick people for their inability to make money as they could not work. The schemes did not cover the “medical bills that people incurred in the hospital”.
The country’s medical system received major boost between 1900 and 1940. The health care scheme, for instance, incorporated several aspects, such as vaccines, diagnoses of infectious diseases, measures for blood pressure, and X-ray technology, into the system. These advancements were legitimized by the creation of medical regulations to guide the practices of physicians.
For instance, the American Medical Association, established the Council on Medical Education in 1904, to develop and implement medical standards through issuance of medical licenses. There occurred another step in 1913 after the Council on Medical Education was founded. The American College of Surgeons, a body that was supposed to regulate the accreditation of medical institution, came to existence. The college closed down by 1915 but more than 35 medical schools had been found to be unfit.
The modern day health care insurance plans sprang up in 1929 and in the early 1930s as a result of several factors. The first one was the increase of demand for medical services from the citizens. The second factor was the limited supply of medical equipment hospitals and the low number of health practitioners, which could not meet the high demand. As a result, “the medical cost increased so much that many citizens could not afford to pay for their medical services”.
Different personalities came up with different plans to cater for the country’s population. For example, Dr. Justin Ford Kimball is remembered for the part he played in the development of the modern health care system in 1929. Justin developed a system called the Baylor Plan, in which teachers were required to contribute 50 cents every month to cater for their medical services for a period of up to 21 days per year.
Many hospitals, after the occurrence of the Great Depression in 1930, were forced to begin offering medical plans to their clients and they adopted the Baylor Plan. The schemes, most of which were prepaid, not only enabled the subscribers to get affordable medical coverage, but it also enabled the hospitals to receive constant income in spite of the staggering state of economy at that time.
Toward the end of the 1940s, several private, commercial medical insurance plans had developed. The companies that offered the plan introduced premium charges based on the relative risk, which saw older people paying more than any other group. The Blue Shield and Blue Cross plans, which were by that time regarded as not-for-profit schemes, eventually began to charge premiums for fear of losing business to the commercial companies.
The presence of successful health care schemes in the 1950s kept the government from involving in the schemes. However, in 1965, the government intervened and introduced Medicaid and Medicare programs to complement the plans that were offered by the private sector.
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, a number of technologies were introduced into the medical field making the plans very expensive to the common citizens. The Congress responded by pushing for development of other schemes to cater for the poor. As a result of the Congress’ efforts, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the Mental Health Parity Act came to existence in mid 1990s.
Before these plans that were enacted by the Congress, President Bill Clinton had made a proposal in 1993 to enact a universal medical plan in the country. However, Bill’s proposal was blocked before it could be implemented. President George Bush’s “attempts in 2003 to add more contents to the Medicare program were also thwarted”.
Since 2003, several attempts to develop a national health care system in the United States have been made by different personalities, but none of them has succeeded. There is a lot of politics in the medical field, which frustrates the development of some of the plans that seem to care for the poor.
As a result of the rising medical costs, “very many people in the United States remain uninsured”. For instance, a study conducted in 2007 by the U.S. Census of Bureau found that more than 15% of the country’s population was not covered by any medical plan. Before thinking about the best kind of health care plan to develop for the citizens, the personalities involved should keep politics aside.
","The American health care system is a complex and multifaceted entity that has been the subject of much debate and scrutiny in recent years. Despite being one of the wealthiest and most technologically advanced countries in the world, the United States has struggled to provide its citizens with affordable, accessible, and high-quality health care.


At the heart of the American health care system are private insurance companies, which are responsible for providing coverage to the vast majority of Americans. Private insurance is typically obtained through an employer or purchased individually, and it varies widely in terms of cost and coverage. While some Americans have access to comprehensive insurance plans that cover a range of medical services, others face high premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket expenses.


One of the most significant challenges facing the American health care system is the issue of affordability. Health care costs in the United States are among the highest in the world, and many Americans struggle to afford basic medical care. This is particularly true for individuals without insurance, who may be forced to pay out-of-pocket for medical services or go without care altogether. In addition, even those with insurance often face high out-of-pocket costs, such as deductibles and copays, which can be financially crippling for low- and middle-income families.


Another major issue with the American health care system is access. While most Americans have some form of health insurance, many still face significant barriers to accessing care. For example, individuals living in rural areas may not have access to medical facilities or providers, while those living in low-income areas may have limited options for medical care. Additionally, certain populations, such as undocumented immigrants, may be excluded from accessing health care services altogether.


The quality of care provided by the American health care system is also a matter of concern. While the United States has some of the most advanced medical technologies and facilities in the world, the quality of care varies widely depending on factors such as income, race, and geographic location. For example, individuals living in low-income areas or in areas with high rates of poverty may have limited access to high-quality medical care, leading to disparities in health outcomes.


In recent years, the American health care system has been the subject of significant political debate, particularly surrounding the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. The ACA, which was passed in 2010, aimed to expand access to health care coverage and reduce costs for millions of Americans. However, the law has been the subject of numerous legal challenges and attempts at repeal, and its long-term future remains uncertain.


One potential solution to the challenges facing the American health care system is a single-payer system, in which the government would be responsible for providing health insurance coverage to all citizens. This approach is used in many other countries, and proponents argue that it would reduce costs, improve access, and ensure that all Americans have access to high-quality health care. However, opponents argue that a single-payer system would be too costly, would limit patient choice, and would reduce innovation in the health care sector.


Another potential solution is to expand and improve upon the existing private insurance system. This could include measures such as reducing costs for low-income individuals, increasing competition among insurance providers, and implementing regulations to ensure that all insurance plans meet minimum standards for coverage and quality of care.


One thing that is clear is that the status quo is not working. Too many Americans are struggling to access the care they need, and too many are being forced to choose between their health and their financial stability. As the country continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become even more apparent that a strong, resilient, and equitable health care system is essential to the well-being of all Americans.


One potential avenue for reform is a focus on preventative care and public health initiatives. By investing in programs and services that help individuals maintain their health and prevent chronic illnesses, the overall burden on the health care system could be reduced. This could include measures such as increasing access to healthy food options, promoting physical activity, and investing in community health centers and other resources that provide care to underserved populations.


Another important consideration is the role of technology in the health care system. Advances in telemedicine, artificial intelligence, and other technologies have the potential to transform the way health care is delivered, making it more efficient, cost-effective, and patient-centered. However, it is important to ensure that these technologies are accessible to all Americans, regardless of income or geographic location.


Ultimately, any meaningful reform of the American health care system will require a willingness to address the root causes of the problems facing the system, including income inequality, systemic racism, and the profit-driven nature of the health care industry. It will require a recognition that health care is a human right, and a commitment to ensuring that all Americans have access to the care they need to live healthy and productive lives.


In the end, the future of the American health care system will be shaped by the choices we make today. It will require a collective effort by policymakers, health care providers, and patients to build a system that truly puts the needs of the people first. By working together and embracing a spirit of innovation, compassion, and equity, we can create a health care system that reflects the best of American values and ensures that all Americans have the opportunity to live healthy, fulfilling lives.

What Is Good Writing?,"Good writing has been given various definitions by different people. Every individual understands the meaning of good writing in their unique ways and thus it has come to be an issue of controversy as to what good writing is. In my opinion, good writing is creative writing that directly responds to the reader’s interests, has captivating ideas, and begs the reader’s attention to continue reading. Good writing is subjective and depends on the writer and the reader. Writing is like an art. If the writer thinks it is good, it can be good writing, and if the reader thinks it is good it also can be good writing.

Ideas are the main part of writing and constitute the main reason for wanting to write in the first place.

According to Allen, good writing must have its ideas effectively organized and communicated to flow from one idea to the next one. Ideas are the main part of writing and constitute the main reason for wanting to write in the first place. Mostly, good writing is composed of the main idea which is the thesis statement and a whole lot of intriguing details that make the writing good. The main idea in writing must be of importance to the writer and audience and also be a sentence that can stand on its own.

These ideas and details must be organized in such a way that the writer has the beginning and the end. The author further asserts that a writer must come up with an introduction that stimulates the reader’s mind in a captivating manner. Also, the ideas must be arranged in a way that each leads to the other in a smooth and flowing mode. Finally, the conclusion must satisfactorily feel finished to the readers and should leave them with food for thought.

Good writing must have parts that are easy to follow; that is, they should use transitional phrases such as next, finally, then and so forth.

Just like any other task, writing is a process that requires preparation. Before a writer sits to put down the ideas, they must gather and organize those ideas by thinking and researching. The writer should then compare his or her opinions with those of others from the research. They also ought to plan, write, and finally proofread to ensure that their work has no errors whatsoever. Therefore, one must start by thinking of what they want to write about, whom they are writing for, and the kind of document they want to write.

Before a writer sits to put down their ideas, they must gather and organize those ideas by thinking and researching.

It is widely agreed upon that good writing should always be paraphrased, summarized, or quoted if taken from a particular source that should be credited. Universal understanding is also essential in good writing. The writers should be simple and clear in what they are conveying. Thus, complex words should be avoided and instead common English language that is understood by all should be used. Any writing that does not stick to all these points is considered to be bad.

Thinking and research precede writing; therefore, good writing depends upon one’s quality of research and critical thinking

As McClure puts it, thinking and research precede writing. Therefore, good writing depends on one’s quality of research and critical thinking. Ideas are developed in the mind and once one has given a clear thought of what they are going to write about and the intended audience, then one is ready to start. In the author’s view, it is essential to jot down ideas that come across one’s mind and also the main points from a source so as not to forget.

This will enable the writer to gather and organize the main ideas and draft them easily later. Critical thinking is vital during research as it helps one to differentiate between valuable and useful information for one’s writing from that which is not useful. It is also crucial because by thinking critically one can avoid trusting every information from a source as some facts stated in the source might be untrue.

However, the methods of finding and evaluating information keep changing from time to time. Most studies, for instance, have indicated that most researchers use the internet to do their research. Nevertheless, one should be cautious as information from some websites such as Wikipedia is not considered reliable. In as much as such websites are not advocated for research purposes, they are very important in doing preliminary research and seeking information. There are some reasons why these sites are not approved for academic research, and one of the reasons is that they lack accuracy and accountability. The information posted on these sites can be removed or altered at any time thus resulting in their unreliability.

After editing, one should proofread their work to weed out any spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, punctuation mistakes, and the correct choice of words.

Allen then advises that thorough research and clear thinking should be followed by the drafting process where one puts all the collected information into the paper. During the drafting stage, one should not be worried about many details as long as one’s writing follows the plan. Once one is finished with the draft, the next step is to reread and edit the draft to see if there are any errors. The best way to do this is to give someone to read and correct mistakes. After editing, one should proofread their work to weed out any spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, punctuation mistakes, and the correct choice of words. This can be done by oneself, but for it to be effective someone else who has not read the draft can be found to proofread the work.

In conclusion, a writer must always know the purpose of writing, putting the intended readers in mind. This will aid the author in writing a good piece of work thus making it enjoyable to read most especially and not limited to the targeted audience. Lastly, reading is the best way to determine great writing and a writer can determine if their work is good or poor.","Writing is a form of communication that has been essential to human existence since the beginning of time. From cave paintings to modern-day novels, writing has allowed humans to convey ideas, emotions, and stories across time and space. But what makes writing ""good""? Is it the use of language? The structure of the piece? The content? In this essay, we will explore the different elements that make up good writing.

Firstly, good writing must have a clear and concise message. It should be easy for the reader to understand what the writer is trying to convey. The message should be communicated effectively and efficiently. This means that the writer should avoid using convoluted sentences or complex vocabulary that might confuse the reader. Instead, the language should be simple and straightforward, with the purpose of the piece being clearly stated.

Secondly, good writing should be engaging. It should capture the reader's attention and maintain their interest throughout the piece. This can be achieved through the use of descriptive language, vivid imagery, and interesting characters or plotlines. The writer should strive to create a piece that is not only informative, but also entertaining and enjoyable to read.

Thirdly, good writing should be well-organized. The structure of the piece should be logical and easy to follow. This means that the writer should use headings, subheadings, and paragraphs to break up the text and guide the reader through the piece. Additionally, the writer should use transitions to connect ideas and ensure that the piece flows smoothly.

Fourthly, good writing should be appropriate for the intended audience. The tone and language used in the piece should be tailored to the readership. For example, a scientific paper might use technical language and be aimed at a specialized audience, while a children's book would use simple language and be aimed at a younger audience. The writer should consider who their audience is and adjust their writing style accordingly.

Finally, good writing should be well-edited. The writer should ensure that the piece is free of grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and typos. This not only makes the piece easier to read, but also demonstrates the writer's attention to detail and professionalism.

Some may argue that good writing is subjective and varies from person to person. While it is true that different people may have different preferences when it comes to writing style or content, there are certain universal elements that make up good writing. Clear communication, engagement, organization, appropriateness, and editing are all key factors that contribute to good writing.

Additionally, good writing has the power to influence and inspire. It can spark ideas, ignite passions, and bring about change. Good writing can be used to tell stories, educate, and share knowledge. It can be used to convey emotions and provoke thought. In this way, good writing is a powerful tool that has the ability to impact society in a meaningful way.

On the other hand, bad writing can be detrimental. It can be confusing, boring, and frustrating to read. It can cause misunderstandings and miscommunications. Poorly written documents can lead to legal or financial repercussions. In this way, bad writing can have a negative impact on individuals and society as a whole.

Furthermore, good writing is not only important in the academic and professional spheres, but also in our everyday lives. We use writing to communicate with our friends and family, to express our thoughts and feelings, and to record our memories. Good writing can make these everyday interactions more meaningful and enjoyable.

In conclusion, good writing is a combination of clear communication, engagement, organization, appropriateness, and editing. It is a powerful tool that has the ability to influence and inspire. Good writing is not only important in academic and professional settings, but also in our everyday lives. It is a skill that can be developed and honed over time, with practice and dedication.

Moreover, good writing can be a reflection of a person's character and values. A writer who puts effort into their writing and strives for excellence may also demonstrate these qualities in other areas of their life. Good writing can also show empathy and understanding, as the writer seeks to connect with their readers and convey their message effectively.

In contrast, bad writing can be a reflection of laziness, carelessness, or lack of skill. It can show a disregard for the reader's time and attention, and a lack of respect for the importance of clear communication. Bad writing can also be a missed opportunity to share important information, inspire others, or make a positive impact.

In conclusion, good writing is an essential skill that is important in both professional and personal contexts. It is a combination of clear communication, engagement, organization, appropriateness, and editing, and has the power to influence and inspire. As such, it is important for individuals to strive for excellence in their writing, and for society to value and prioritize good writing as a means of effective communication and expression.",Argumentative,

When their website ranks high in the search engines, they are likely to get more clicks or signups hence earning more commission.
In conclusion, commercial organizations widely use data mining as follows. Sales department of commercial companies use data mining to carry out customer churning. Customer churning involves using the buying behavior to predict whether the company is losing its customers to its rivals. Management uses the customer churning results to regulate production hence averting losses. Marketing department uses data mining technique to facilitate market analysis, segmentation, maximizing profits and minimizing expenditure.
Human resource department uses data mining technology to oversee staff monitoring, development and termination. Finally, entrepreneurs have made a lot of money using data mining software. In summary, use of data mining is very instrumental for business organization management and investment.


","Data mining is a process of analyzing large sets of data to extract useful information and discover patterns that can help businesses make informed decisions. As technology has advanced and data collection has become easier, data mining has become an increasingly valuable tool for businesses seeking to gain insights into consumer behavior, optimize their operations, and mitigate risks. However, the commercial uses of data mining raise a range of ethical considerations that must be carefully managed to ensure that the benefits of data mining are realized without infringing on individuals' rights or creating new risks.


One of the most significant ethical considerations related to data mining is privacy. Data mining often involves collecting large amounts of personal information about individuals, including their browsing habits, purchasing behavior, and even their location. This raises concerns about how this data is collected, stored, and used. Individuals have a right to privacy, and businesses must take steps to ensure that their data mining practices are transparent and respect individuals' privacy rights.


Another ethical consideration is the potential for discrimination or bias. Data mining relies on algorithms to identify patterns and make predictions about consumer behavior. However, these algorithms can sometimes produce biased results that discriminate against certain groups, such as minorities or people with disabilities. This can lead to unfair treatment and perpetuate existing inequalities. To prevent this, businesses must ensure that their data mining algorithms are free from bias and do not unfairly discriminate against any group.


A third ethical consideration is the risk of data breaches. As businesses collect and store increasing amounts of data, they become vulnerable to cyber attacks and data breaches. These breaches can result in the theft of personal information, which can be used for identity theft, fraud, and other illegal activities. To protect individuals' personal information, businesses must take steps to secure their data and prevent unauthorized access.


Despite these ethical considerations, data mining has become an essential tool for businesses seeking to gain insights into consumer behavior and optimize their operations. By analyzing large amounts of data, businesses can identify patterns and trends that can help them make informed decisions about product development, marketing strategies, and pricing. They can also use data mining to optimize their supply chains, reduce costs, and improve their overall efficiency.


One area where data mining has proven particularly valuable is in the field of marketing. By analyzing consumer behavior, businesses can gain insights into what products and services are in demand, how customers prefer to shop, and what factors influence their purchasing decisions. They can then use this information to develop targeted marketing campaigns that are more likely to resonate with their target audience. For example, data mining can help a retailer identify which products are most popular among different age groups, genders, or geographic regions, allowing them to tailor their advertising and promotions to better meet the needs of each group.


Data mining is also valuable in the field of finance, where it is used to identify patterns and trends in financial data. For example, banks can use data mining to analyze their customers' financial behavior and identify those who are most likely to default on loans or miss payments. They can then take steps to mitigate these risks, such as offering lower interest rates to customers with good credit scores or requiring collateral for higher-risk loans.


In the healthcare industry, data mining is used to analyze patient data and identify patterns that can help doctors and other healthcare professionals make better diagnoses and treatment decisions. For example, data mining can be used to analyze patient data to identify risk factors for certain diseases or to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from certain treatments.


Data mining is also used in the field of law enforcement to identify criminal activity and prevent future crimes. For example, police departments can use data mining to analyze crime patterns and identify areas where crime is more likely to occur. This can help them allocate resources more effectively and prevent crimes before they happen.


One potential approach to mitigating these risks is to prioritize transparency and accountability. By being open about the data they collect and how it is used, companies can help build trust with consumers and avoid potential legal or reputational issues. Additionally, companies can implement clear policies and procedures for handling data, including protocols for responding to data breaches and ensuring compliance with relevant laws and regulations. These measures can help ensure that data mining is conducted in a responsible and ethical manner, and that companies are held accountable for any misuse or mishandling of data.


Another important consideration for companies using data mining is the potential for discrimination or bias. As data mining algorithms are only as unbiased as the data they are trained on, companies must be mindful of potential biases in the data sets they use. For example, if a company's data set primarily consists of data from certain demographics, it may not accurately represent the broader population, leading to biased results. To avoid this issue, companies can strive to use more diverse data sets and employ techniques such as data anonymization to minimize the potential for discrimination or bias.


Overall, while there are significant ethical considerations that must be taken into account when using data mining for commercial purposes, the potential benefits of this technology are clear. From optimizing business operations to improving customer experiences, data mining can provide valuable insights that can help companies succeed in today's highly competitive marketplace. However, to fully realize these benefits, companies must approach data mining with a thoughtful and responsible mindset, prioritizing transparency, accountability, and ethical considerations. By doing so, they can leverage the power of data mining to gain a competitive edge while also ensuring that they uphold their obligations to their customers, employees, and society as a whole.


",Expository,
Should Organic Food Be Promoted?,"The concern for the environment becomes more widespread all around the world, and people try to change their lifestyle to minimise the potential harm to the ecology. Consuming organic food and supporting organic farmers are some of the most straightforward ways to contribute to the cause without significant efforts. According to New York Post, “the U.S. Department of Agriculture certifies products as organic if they meet certain requirements including being produced without synthetic pesticides or fertilisers, or routine use of antibiotics or growth hormones.” Thus, for farmers it a conscious choice that entails hard labour and extra resources, and it should be worth doing.

Organic farming is a form of agriculture that employs crop rotation, green manure, compost and biological pest control, but sometimes fertilizers and pesticides are also allowed, though only if they are considered natural. There are some advantages related to organic farming, most of them pertaining to the ethical use of soil, seeds and labour to decrease the negative impact of human activities on the landscape, water, people and wildlife.

Ecological agriculture, being a part of organic farming, is relevant not only for developed countries but even more so for the developing world because it can contribute to the growth of local people’s income, employment and socio-economic stability. However, this approach has some disadvantages too, as not all countries are suitable for traditional crop production systems due to problematic soil and rapid growth of population.

For example, to avoid food shortage and extra labour local farmers in Tanzania had to start using glyphosate after years of the traditional approach to growing maize. It was approved for small farm use and helped them fight weeds which otherwise would have needed ploughing, and, thus, protected the soil from deterioration and gave sufficient harvest.

Growing interest in fitness and quality of life, environmental preservation and safe products encourage US families to choose organic. In 2011 organic food sales reached $29.2 billion and had been rising an average of 9.4% for the next five years. A whole range of factors influences the choice of consumers in favour of organic products, even though the price for them is usually higher.

Rana and Paul overviewed several studies on the topic of the behaviour and intentions of buyers and summarised the results from the USA, Sweden, Malaysia and Italy. According to them, most people associate organic products with wellbeing and pleasure, and consumers choose certified organic food to adhere to a healthy diet and good nutrition to make their lives more wholesome. Another crucial reason for the widespread popularity of organic food is the idea of its safety due to the absence of chemicals in the process of its production. This feature is a considerable advantage over conventionally grown food because people tend to avoid possibly harmful substances.

It is important to notice that “organic” refers to the way the food is produced, but not to its inherent qualities. Contrary to general beliefs, organic products do not have extra nutritional value when compared to other products, when 51% of buyers confirm that they choose organic for its nutritional characteristics. However, promoting organic products in this way would mean misleading people; thus, the emphasis should lie with the safe process of production.

Concerns towards the current ecological situation are also one of the driving forces in ethical consumerism. Those who want to participate in the protection of the environment and cut the negative impact of human activities on the environment buy organic products. It is also one of the popular trends in developed countries as a healthy lifestyle becomes more affordable, and people tend to invest in organic food.

Promoting organic food requires a special approach, oriented at the local people, and a steady supply as, according to Rana and Paul, “less availability of organic food at retail stores remains a key deterrent and barrier in generating sales and customer loyalty”. This data is also confirmed by research carried out by way of interviews of regular organic food buyers in retail and organic food stores in Germany.

This study showed that organic products make up less than half of their budget, and the main reason for that is insufficient availability. Thus, buyers need to be more confident about the reliability of the suppliers and vendors to purchase more organic products. This correlation is proved by the analysis of questionnaires collected at different food markets, and the findings showed that consumers tend to make decisions based on a trust in the organic label.

It is a common case when farmers have doubts about engaging in organic farming because of the difficult and expensive certification process, a limited number of sales channels and restricted market. However, certification is seen by people as a guarantee of quality and safety, so it helps to promote organic products and make it worth the effort for farmers.

Finding original routes to potential consumers of organic products and raising awareness of its benefits are vital for successful promotion and further development of farmers. The study conducted by Kummer, Hirner and Milestad explores an example of growing clientele and establishing long-term cooperation with them with the help of subscription boxes. They were filled with different organic products, accompanied by leaflets with the information on the food and its producers, and eventually sent to the subscribers. This scheme satisfied both farmers and customers because it allowed flexibility, was easy to use and formed direct relations between producers and consumers.

Going organic for farmers means adopting certain social and political views because the idea is closely related to environmental politics and directly supports its causes. This is the reason for organic products to be viewed as a contribution to the ecology, and not as a way to a healthier diet, as there is no evidence for its nutritional superiority. An inventive approach to promotion and honesty in relationships with customers should help organic farmers to profit because this market still holds significant potential and interest for many people.","In recent years, there has been a growing movement towards promoting organic food. Proponents of organic food argue that it is healthier, safer, and better for the environment than conventionally grown food. However, there are also those who argue that promoting organic food is unnecessary and potentially harmful. In this essay, I will argue that organic food should be promoted, as it offers numerous benefits to both human health and the environment.

One of the main arguments for promoting organic food is that it is healthier than conventionally grown food. Organic food is grown without the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, which can leave residues on the food and have negative effects on human health. For example, some pesticides have been linked to cancer, neurotoxicity, and developmental problems in children. Organic food is also free from genetically modified organisms (GMOs), which have been linked to a range of health problems, including allergies, digestive problems, and even cancer.

Organic food is also believed to be more nutritious than conventionally grown food. A study conducted by the European Union found that organic food has higher levels of certain nutrients, including vitamin C, iron, and zinc, than conventionally grown food. This is because organic farming practices focus on soil health and biodiversity, which can lead to healthier and more nutrient-dense crops.

Another argument for promoting organic food is that it is better for the environment. Organic farming practices are designed to be more sustainable than conventional farming practices, which often rely heavily on synthetic inputs and can lead to soil erosion, water pollution, and other environmental problems. Organic farmers use natural methods to improve soil health, such as crop rotation, cover cropping, and composting, which can help to reduce erosion and improve soil fertility. Organic farmers also tend to use less water than conventional farmers, as they rely on natural rainfall and irrigation techniques that are less wasteful.

In addition to being better for the environment and human health, promoting organic food can also have economic benefits. Organic farming can be more profitable for farmers than conventional farming, as organic crops often command a higher price in the marketplace. This can help to support local economies and promote sustainable agriculture practices. In addition, promoting organic food can help to reduce the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, which can be costly for farmers and have negative impacts on local ecosystems.

Despite these benefits, there are those who argue against promoting organic food. One of the main arguments against promoting organic food is that it is more expensive than conventionally grown food, making it inaccessible to many people. While it is true that organic food can be more expensive, this is largely due to the fact that organic farming practices are often more labor-intensive and require more land than conventional farming practices. However, as demand for organic food increases, it is likely that prices will decrease as economies of scale are realized.

Another argument against promoting organic food is that it is not necessarily more sustainable than conventional farming practices. Critics argue that organic farming can be less efficient than conventional farming, as it often requires more land and resources to produce the same amount of food. In addition, some argue that the use of natural pesticides and fertilizers in organic farming can be just as harmful to the environment as synthetic pesticides and fertilizers. However, these criticisms are largely unfounded, as research has shown that organic farming can be just as productive as conventional farming, and can even be more sustainable in the long run.

In conclusion, promoting organic food is an important step towards creating a healthier, more sustainable food system. Organic food offers numerous benefits to both human health and the environment, and can help to support local economies and promote sustainable agriculture practices. While there are those who argue against promoting organic food, their criticisms are largely unfounded, and the benefits of promoting organic food far outweigh the potential costs.

Furthermore, promoting organic food can also help to address issues of food justice and equity. In many low-income communities, access to healthy and nutritious food is limited, which can contribute to higher rates of diet-related illnesses such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. By promoting organic food, we can help to increase access to healthy and nutritious food for all communities, regardless of income or social status.

Moreover, promoting organic food can also contribute to the preservation of biodiversity and the protection of natural ecosystems. Organic farming practices prioritize the use of natural inputs and techniques, which can help to support the health and well-being of local ecosystems. By promoting organic farming, we can help to reduce the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, which can have negative impacts on biodiversity and the health of local ecosystems.

In contrast, conventional farming practices often rely heavily on synthetic inputs, which can have negative impacts on soil health and local ecosystems. Synthetic pesticides and fertilizers can pollute waterways and harm wildlife, and the use of GMOs can lead to the loss of genetic diversity in crops and the emergence of resistant pests and diseases. By promoting organic farming practices, we can help to reduce these negative impacts and promote a more sustainable and resilient food system.

Finally, promoting organic food can also contribute to the development of new and innovative farming practices that prioritize the health and well-being of farmers and their communities. By supporting organic farming, we can help to create a more diverse and resilient food system that is better equipped to meet the challenges of the 21st century. This can include the development of new technologies and techniques that reduce the use of synthetic inputs and promote soil health, as well as the development of new markets and distribution systems that prioritize the needs of local communities.

In conclusion, promoting organic food is an important step towards creating a healthier, more sustainable, and more equitable food system. While there are those who argue against promoting organic food, the benefits of organic farming far outweigh the potential costs. By supporting organic farming practices, we can help to create a food system that is better equipped to meet the challenges of the 21st century, and that prioritizes the health and well-being of farmers, communities, and the planet as a whole.",Argumentative,
Advertising Ethics in the Modern Consumer Society Essay,"In the field of advertising, the guidelines for ensuring an ethical approach to products and service promotion are a vital issue. When initiating a marketing strategy and attempting to popularize a particular brand, the executives are always forced to consider the impact of the chosen approach on the target audience (Patterson & Wilkins, 2013). In the business environment, all enterprises are expected to follow the doctrines of corporate social responsibility, preventing such adverse effects of inappropriate promotion as indecency and enrichment through unethical means. Therefore, researchers and company owners have dedicated additional efforts to developing regulations for ethical advertising conduct (The Arthur W. Page Center, n.d.). Considering that incorrectly performed advertising campaigns can negatively influence the public, leading to such consequences as misrepresentation of knowledge and unethical persuasion, ethical advertising remains a crucial question in the present consumer society.

In the modern age, several methods can be implemented to promote an organization’s products or services among the target audience. Typically, three modes of advertising are utilized to distinguish between the various approaches to brand promotion, namely Above-The-Line (ATL), Below-The-Line (BTL), and Through-The-Line (TTL) advertising. In Above-The-Line advertising, the necessary activities are performed at the macro-level, which typically refers to national, regional, or international actions aimed at promoting a certain product or service (Reeves, 2017). Considering the large span of such endeavors, the organization implementing ATL is required to use global sources of advertising, such as particular types of social media. Television, cinema, radio, newspapers, and magazines can be utilized in this approach to impact a broad audience and establish a positive image for the brand.

At the micro-level, Below-The-Line advertising can be especially efficient. To conduct this promotional method, the company executives must follow the goal of building loyalty among the target consumers. Contrastingly to the ATL approach, BTL is focused on adapting to the individuals’ needs according to their preferences and desires (Reeves, 2017). Nevertheless, as the main customer group is still the mass audience, enterprises typically use such measures as direct mail, sponsorship, public relations, and telemarketing.

Finally, Through-The-Line advertising is considered a more integrated communication approach, which allows the firms to remain in close contact with current and potential buyers. In TTL, the brand is expected to utilize various communication pathways to approach the consumers, conducting an advertising campaign across various types of media that can potentially influence the customers’ choices (Reeves, 2017). From this perspective, TTL includes the aspects of both ATL and BTL, suggesting such promotional activities as television, radio, social media, public networks, and personalized emails.

As a marketing strategy, advertising has several distinct advantages that help the corporation to promote its standing and improve society. For business owners, advertising can be an efficient means of promoting their products and services among different audiences, which is necessary for elevating the level of customer reach (Patterson & Wilkins, 2013). In addition, this activity ensures that customers are aware of the company’s brand and its primary characteristics, meaning that they can make an informed decision about purchasing the suggested products (The Arthur W. Page Center, n.d.). After that, a productive advertising strategy can improve the organization’s position in the market, securing extra advantages against the competition. Considering that overcoming the opponents is crucial for positive growth and may help improve the customers’ interest in the brand, relevant advertising methods must be included in the firm’s marketing strategy (Amazeen, 2022). Nevertheless, such activities should always be conducted in consideration of the ethical standards established by advertising ethics.

Contemporary business practices are consistently governed by the ethical standards developed for the fields of communications, public relationships, and corporate responsibility. Considering the substantial impact that a company may have on a particular audience, ensuring the ethicality of its endeavors and promoting decent advertising behaviors are vital procedures (Amazeen, 2022). Advertising ethics is the sphere that defines and describes the guidelines for the interactions between the seller and buyer, introducing methods for preserving decency within promotional campaigns (Patterson & Wilkins, 2013). Although the scope of modern advertising is quite expansive, covering various types of communication channels and interactive modes, the basic idea, as suggested by advertising ethics, is to maintain appropriateness when promoting the brand (The Arthur W. Page Center, n.d.). Therefore, all companies must comply with the requirements of advertising ethics, following the ethical norms and carefully ascertaining the possible influence of their campaigns on the broad audience.

Another essential point covered by advertising ethics is the content of the marketing campaigns. Given the instances of knowledge fabrication and the possibility of misleading the consumers in an attempt to secure better financial outputs, advertising ethics prescribes that such activities cannot be condoned and are deemed unethical (Maheshwari, 2016). An appropriate promotional campaign must always adhere to the basic principles of ethical behavior, presenting truthful statements and avoiding any claims that can be misinterpreted by the audience (Maheshwari, 2016). In addition, the companies are expected not to use advertising for persuasion, as the primary objective of promotion should be the distribution of information to allow the customers to make informed decisions regarding their purchases (The Arthur W. Page Center, n.d.). As such, creating an image of a product that must be present in any household is an excellent example of an advertisement that integrates false claims and indecent promotional activities (Patterson & Wilkins, 2013). In this regard, advertising ethics allows for controlling the communication practices and mitigating instances of inappropriate marketing.

In light of the discussed evidence, the ethical approach to advertising appears to be a vital topic for the modern age. Considering the variety of media services that can be utilized to promote a certain product or service, it becomes relatively easy to influence the customers’ choices by creating a particular amount of pressure (Amazeen, 2022). Nevertheless, such actions are considered unethical and indecent, as they exploit the consumers’ vulnerabilities and can provide false information about specific ideas or events (Patterson & Wilkins, 2013). Ethical principles allow for regulating such behaviors, introducing guidelines for ethical practices, and clearly stating which activities can negatively affect society. From this perspective, integrating ethics into advertising is essential for ensuring that company-consumer communication is ethical and appropriate.","Advertising is an essential aspect of modern consumer society. It allows businesses to reach a wider audience and promote their products or services to potential customers. However, the rise of advertising has also led to concerns about the ethics of advertising practices. In this essay, we will explore the ethical considerations that arise in modern advertising and how they impact both businesses and consumers.

One of the main ethical considerations in advertising is the use of deceptive or misleading tactics. Advertising that uses exaggerated or false claims about a product or service can mislead consumers and result in negative consequences for both the business and the consumer. For example, a company that claims its product can cure a serious illness when it cannot can face legal and financial repercussions. It is essential for businesses to be transparent and honest in their advertising practices to ensure that consumers can make informed decisions.

Another ethical issue in advertising is the use of manipulative tactics to influence consumer behavior. For instance, ads that use emotional appeals to elicit a response from consumers can be considered manipulative. Advertisers may also use tactics like fear-mongering or creating a sense of urgency to encourage consumers to make purchases they may not need or want. While such tactics may increase sales, they can be ethically questionable.

Moreover, the use of stereotypes and discrimination in advertising is another ethical issue that has come under scrutiny in recent years. Advertisements that perpetuate negative stereotypes based on race, gender, or ethnicity can be offensive and hurtful. In addition, ads that promote unrealistic beauty standards or objectify women are also considered unethical. Advertisers must be mindful of the messages they are sending and ensure that their advertising is inclusive and respectful of all individuals.


The impact of advertising on vulnerable populations is another area of concern. For example, children are a particularly vulnerable group, and advertisers must be careful to ensure that their ads do not exploit children or promote harmful products to them. In addition, advertisements that target individuals with addiction or mental health issues can be seen as taking advantage of their vulnerabilities. Advertisers have a responsibility to promote responsible and ethical practices when advertising to vulnerable populations.

The use of data and technology in advertising has also raised ethical questions. In particular, the collection and use of personal data can be a cause for concern. Businesses may use data to track consumer behavior and preferences, which can help them to create targeted advertising campaigns. However, the use of personal data without consent or for unethical purposes can be a violation of consumer privacy rights. Advertisers must ensure that they are transparent about their data collection practices and respect the privacy of their customers.

their brand reputation and lead to long-term success. In addition, ethical advertising can contribute to a healthier and more equitable society, where all individuals are respected and valued. To promote ethical advertising practices, businesses can take several steps. Firstly, they can establish clear guidelines and standards for their advertising practices, ensuring that all ads are truthful, respectful, and inclusive. They can also provide training and support to their advertising teams, helping them to understand the importance of ethical practices and how to implement them in their work. Additionally, businesses can engage with consumers and other stakeholders to gather feedback on their advertising practices and make improvements where necessary.

Regulation is another important aspect of promoting ethical advertising practices. Governments and regulatory bodies can establish laws and standards that ensure advertising practices are fair, honest, and ethical. For example, laws can prohibit the use of deceptive advertising practices or require advertisers to disclose information about their data collection practices. By establishing regulations and enforcing them effectively, governments can help to protect consumers and promote ethical practices in the advertising industry.

Consumers also have a role to play in promoting ethical advertising practices. By becoming informed about the products and services they are considering purchasing, consumers can make informed decisions and avoid being misled by false or deceptive advertising. Additionally, consumers can support businesses that engage in ethical advertising practices, encouraging others to follow suit. Through their purchasing power, consumers can send a message to businesses that ethical practices are important and valued.

Finally, the impact of advertising on the environment is another ethical consideration. Many products are advertised in a way that promotes consumption and disposability, leading to the creation of waste and pollution. Advertisers must consider the impact of their advertising on the environment and promote sustainable practices that minimize waste and promote responsible consumption.

In conclusion, advertising is an essential aspect of modern consumer society, but it is also a field that raises many ethical questions. Advertisers must be mindful of the impact their practices have on consumers, vulnerable populations, and the environment. Ethical advertising practices can lead to increased consumer trust, improved brand reputation, and ultimately, greater success for businesses. By promoting transparency, honesty, inclusivity, and responsible practices, advertisers can help to ensure that their advertising is ethical and benefits both businesses and consumers. Additionally, it is important to note that ethical advertising practices can have a positive impact on society as a whole. For example, ethical advertising can promote social responsibility, encourage fair competition, and foster a culture of trust between businesses and consumers. Advertisers who adopt ethical practices are more likely to be viewed as trustworthy and credible, which can help to build",Argumentative,
Heraclitus: Fire Is the Principle of Everything,"In philosophy, many prominent thinkers have tried to explain how the world is governed and how everything appears. These explanations articulate appropriate principles, and people are familiar with many of them. For example, Thales states that water is the main element, while Anaximenes emphasizes the role of air. However, when it comes to Heraclitus, he believes that fire is the principle of all that exists. Even though his hypothesis seems to be quite controversial at first sight, specific reasons support and explain the given idea.

In his works, Heraclitus indicates that fire is an underlying principle of everything because all objects are made of this element. At the same time, the philosopher suggests that the given element makes it possible for various phenomena and objects to change. These two statements are not easy to comprehend at the same time because they offer some controversial ideas. This information creates some exegetical challenges of how it is reasonable to interpret the principle.

On the one hand, it is possible to utilize a material approach that will reveal some disadvantages of Heraclitus’ hypothesis. On the other hand, the principle under analysis becomes more notional when it is considered as an attempt to create an abstract explanation of how everything works in the Universe. These two different approaches will explain why Heraclitus mentions that fire has such significance for the world.

Thus, fire occupies an essential role in Heraclitus’ philosophy, and his hypothesis evokes a few challenges. Firstly, one should mention that this element was not popular among ancient Greek philosophers since they considered it the most ephemeral of material elements. In spite of that, Heraclitus indicates that fire is what makes stars shine and that it is crucial for the whole world. Secondly, being a continuator of the Milesian school, Heraclitus is a monist, which means that this thinker believes that reality can be reduced to a single element. It is impossible to state why he chose fire, but many suppose that it is because heat is necessary for life. Finally, a significant challenge arises because the philosopher fails to describe how fire can transform into other elements and preserve its original properties.

Even though the information above stipulates some exegetical opinions, Heraclitus insists on the significance of fire. Thus, he mentions that this element is the governing principle of reality that will judge and convict everything. While this idea does not contradict the thought of fire being a general principle, it is difficult to comprehend how the two are related to each other. Furthermore, Heraclitus makes a controversial statement that fire does not transform into other elements; when it changes, it disappears.

This drastic change results in the fact that this component ceases to exist and is replaced by air. However, the thinker stipulates that fire remains unchanged in some respects after this process. It refers to how this element changes, rather than to its material peculiarities. In other words, fire remains constant because it always transforms according to an ordered and balanced way, and not because it poses material stability.

In addition to that, Heraclitus further develops his idea by mentioning that the existence of fire is commensurate with the objects that it burns. In this case, the philosopher compares fire to gold, stating that all objects are an exchange for fire, just like gold can be exchanged for some goods. Stated differently, one stipulates that these two elements serve as the standard of value that regulates changes. The description is similar to one mentioned above because fire is the principle not because of its material properties, but due to the essential dynamic that it offers. It relates to the fact that this dynamic presents a specific way of how everything can change. Thus, fire is said to be a symbol that describes how all objects and phenomena change and what remains after them.

At this point, one can mention that Heraclitus uses two ways to describe fire. Firstly, he defines it as a material element that is necessary for life and is present within stars. Secondly, it is the symbol that explains how all objects can change their properties. These two definitions seem to imply significant differences, which evokes further considerations. On the one hand, it is possible to state that Heraclitus could not overcome those differences and developed separate explanations of his principle.

On the other hand, one can suppose that the philosopher created those discrepancies intentionally. It refers to the fact that the idea serves to reveal the limitations of the Milesian school of thought. This supposition of Heraclitus’ critical approach sheds light on the issues that have been mentioned previously. Thus, the thinker applies the Milesian philosophical approach to show that it contains some theoretical disadvantages. That is why he chooses fire that is not the most common element for the principle, to design a more conceptual way of explaining how the world works.

Heraclitus is famous for creating the hypothesis that fire is the principle of all that exists. This idea is similar to those of the representatives of the Milesian school, who considered a single element the foundation of everything in the world. While water and air manage to meet the requirements of the Milesian philosophy, fire fails to follow them. It is so because this element does not have any material properties that are necessary for transforming into other objects even though Heraclitus mentions some of them. At the same time, the Ancient Greek philosopher argues that fire turns into a completely different element after it ceases to exist.

Furthermore, the thinker does not stipulate why he chose fire as the center of this concept, which evokes appropriate challenges in interpreting the principle under analysis. It has been indicated that Heraclitus considers fire as a symbol that denotes a process of how all objects change. Thus, fire is the principle of all that exists because it is stable in a way that it always changes objects in an ordered and proportionate manner.","Heraclitus, a pre-Socratic philosopher who lived in Ephesus, in modern-day Turkey, around the 5th century BCE, is known for his philosophy of change, which centers on the idea that everything is in a state of flux. Heraclitus believed that the universe is governed by a universal principle that he called ""Logos,"" which is often translated as ""word"" or ""reason."" Heraclitus argued that this principle is manifested in the world through the constant interplay of opposites, and that fire is the fundamental element that drives this process of change.

Heraclitus believed that the world is constantly changing, and that everything is in a state of flux. He famously stated that ""you cannot step into the same river twice,"" which suggests that everything is constantly in motion and that nothing remains the same. Heraclitus believed that this process of change was driven by the principle of Logos, which he believed was the fundamental principle of the universe. According to Heraclitus, Logos is the source of all things, and it is manifested in the world through the constant interplay of opposites.

One of the most important ideas in Heraclitus' philosophy is the notion that fire is the principle of everything. Heraclitus believed that fire was the most important element in the universe, and that it was the source of all life. He believed that fire was not just a physical element, but also a spiritual one, and that it was the key to understanding the world around us. According to Heraclitus, fire was the symbol of change, and it represented the eternal process of transformation that underlies all of existence.

Heraclitus' belief that fire is the principle of everything is based on his observation of the natural world. Fire, he believed, is the most dynamic of all the elements, and it is constantly changing and transforming. Fire can transform wood into ash, or metal into liquid, and it can also create new life in the form of heat and light. Heraclitus believed that fire was the embodiment of the principle of Logos, and that it represented the constant transformation of the universe.

Heraclitus' belief that fire is the principle of everything has been interpreted in many different ways. Some scholars have suggested that Heraclitus was simply referring to the physical properties of fire, and that he believed that everything in the universe could be reduced to the properties of this element. Others have suggested that Heraclitus was using fire as a metaphor for the process of transformation that underlies all of existence. According to this interpretation, fire represents the dynamic interplay of opposites, which is the fundamental process that drives the universe.

Heraclitus' philosophy of change has had a profound influence on Western thought, and it has been interpreted in many different ways by philosophers throughout history. One of the most important interpretations of Heraclitus' philosophy was developed by the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who saw in Heraclitus' philosophy a profound affirmation of life. Nietzsche believed that Heraclitus' emphasis on change and transformation was a rejection of the idea of a fixed and unchanging reality, and that it was a celebration of the ever-changing nature of existence.

Another important interpretation of Heraclitus' philosophy was developed by the German philosopher Martin Heidegger, who saw in Heraclitus' emphasis on the interplay of opposites a profound critique of the Western philosophical tradition. Heidegger believed that Heraclitus was challenging the traditional dualisms that had dominated Western philosophy, such as the distinction between mind and matter, and that he was pointing the way towards a new kind of thinking that would overcome these dualisms.

In conclusion, Heraclitus' philosophy of change, with its emphasis on the constant interplay of opposites and the principle of Logos, has had a profound influence on Western thought. His belief that fire is the principle of everything has been interpreted in many different ways, but it remains a powerful symbol of transformation and change. Heraclitus' philosophy challenges the idea of a fixed and unchanging reality, and emphasizes the dynamic and ever-changing nature of existence. This emphasis on change and transformation has been an inspiration for many philosophers and thinkers throughout history, including Nietzsche and Heidegger.

Heraclitus' philosophy also has implications for our understanding of the natural world. His observation of the properties of fire and its transformative power can be seen as an early recognition of the fundamental importance of energy in the universe. Today, we understand that energy is the underlying principle that governs all physical processes in the universe, and that everything is in a state of constant change and transformation. Heraclitus' philosophy of change can therefore be seen as an early attempt to understand the fundamental nature of the universe and our place in it.

Finally, Heraclitus' emphasis on the interplay of opposites has important implications for our understanding of human nature and society. His rejection of traditional dualisms and his emphasis on the unity of opposites can be seen as a call for a new kind of thinking that recognizes the complex and dynamic nature of human experience. Heraclitus' philosophy challenges us to embrace the contradictions and tensions in our lives, and to recognize the importance of diversity and difference in shaping our world.

In conclusion, Heraclitus' philosophy of change, with its emphasis on the constant interplay of opposites and the principle of Logos, remains a powerful and influential philosophy that challenges us to rethink our understanding of the universe, human nature, and society. His belief that fire is the principle of everything continues to inspire new ways of thinking about the world around us, and his emphasis on change and transformation remains as relevant today as it was over 2,500 years ago.",Expository,
Mathematics – Concept of Multiplication,"In understanding multiplication, it is essential for students to comprehend addition rules, since they are interrelated in a big way. Multiplication is sometimes referred to as repeated addition whose applications are quicker and more effective.
For example, instead of adding 4+4+4=12, multiplication simplifies it to 4*3=12. If there are for instance three students each with four rulers, this can be shown by putting four rulers in three groups and allow the student to count them individually. The result is that same answer will be obtained. This indicate that addition involves using the actual number of times one would multiply the number to add it.
For example, 4*5= 4+4+4+4+4= 5+5+5+5= 20, on the other hand, multiplication involves dealing with many groups with equal size, or groups with same amount of items in every group. Ability of counting the group number and the items is necessary for one to be able to multiply them. This then shows that addition is an instigator for multiplication where one is able to solve a multiplication problem through repeated addition.
This enables the students to understand addition concepts which include manipulation of groups in order to obtain the total product. Moreover, this assists the students in finding out the quantity or the size of items in several groups of equal size.
For instance, if there are eight pencils in a pack and one decides to buy five such packs, one will be able to know the number of pencils he is having. This problem can be dealt with by addition method of 8+8+8+8+8=40 which is a repeated addition, replaceable by multiplication method of 8*5=40. In addition, students are able to realize that math is all about how to formulate and solve problems but not memorizing or reciting.
This enables students to instead of memorizing math such as 4*8=32; they instead consider that the same answer can be obtained through other methods like 4*8= 8+8+8+8= 24+8=32. This is a good method that lucidly shows multiplication and addition relationship. In addition, student can be able to manipulate groups and the item to obtain similar answer, for example 6*7= 3*7+3*7= 21+21= 42 an aspect that gives a creative method of learning multiplication tables, the exact working of math.
The Commutative property is an operation that occurs when one changes the order of the items involved without alteration of the results. For example, 3-2 is not equal to 2-3. Examples of commutative in addition and multiplication are: x+y=y+x or 12+13=13+12; and x*y=y*x, or 9*5=5*9. Associative property is a process where one can regroup numbers in any way without altering the answer. In this property, the answer is not altered by the way the numbers are combined.
For example, (x+y) +z= x+(y+z). or 3+(5+4)= (3+5)+4=3+(9)=(8)+4= 12; and x*(y*z)= (x*y)*z or 3*(5*4)=(3*5)*4=60. On the other hand, in distributive property a number is capable of being multiplied by a sum of two other numbers or be distributed to this numbers separately and give the same answer. For example, x*(y+z) =x*y+x*z or 4*(3+2) =4*(5)=20 or 4*3+4*2=12+8=20.
These properties help the students through supporting memorization, enabling them to understand properties involved through inclusion of patterns and strategies such as fives and nines.
For example, skip counting assists students in finding multiples of two as well as of five by realizing what they already know. For example, an array could be provided to read 2 roes and 6 columns which can be interpreted as 6 columns of 2 or 2 rows of 6 by turning it around. The same applies in three rows of 5 which a student can interpret as 15 put into 3 rows makes 5 columns- or 5 in each row.
In distributive property personal invented strategy is used when trying to recall one of the handfuls of multiplication facts. For example, a student may realize that 7*9 is hard and opt to add 2 more 7’s to already known 7 multiple: 49 to get 63 hence making it easier to know 7*9=63. In addition, it enables using facts of five to get sixes. For example, in 6*3 problems the student can think that this mean 5 groups of 3 and one more group of 3. That is, 6*3= (5*3)+(1*3)=18.
However, there are some conceptual errors that students make, with common errors involving forgetting the previous knowledge taught. For example, it is common for students to forget the addition and multiplication rules. For example, the rule that 4*3 means counting a group of 4 items three times and instead they add the two figures.
Here, it is important for teachers to review the some important information from the previous topic to activate student’s memories in recalling what they learned about these rules. This is an error brought about by the fact that math is a cumulative subject.
Additionally, students get confused by change of signs when dealing with addition or multiplication at the same time. For example, in a problem such as 3*7+3*7, student may solve it by dealing with addition first and multiplying later, that is 3*(10)*7=210 instead of 21+21=42. This is due to confusion of signs application rule as per the order (which one comes first).
Here teaching the student BODMAS RULE, will ensure they deal with problems containing more than one sign effectively by applying the first sign first. Also illustrating the sign different and cautioning student to ensure that they identify when they are dealing with multiplication and not addition will enable them to deal with this problem.
Another conceptual error arises from confusion of the associative rules with Distributive property rules. Students forget these rules and in many cases, they forget to interpret the signs ending up solving the problems wrongly.
For example if a problem of 4+ (3+5) is provided to the student, they sometime confuse it with 4*(3+5) and instead of solving it as 4+(8)= 12 they end up with (12)+(20)= 32. Here, explaining to the student how the sign before the parenthesis affect the numbers within the parenthesis will enable them when it is needed to distribute and when not. Also this calls for intensive practice and reiteration to develop student’s habit.
Understanding that math is a confusing subject to many students, it is essential to parents, teachers and tutors. This is because mathematics contains many rules as well as formulas to memorize and recall. One way of assisting students to memorize these rules and formulas is correlating them with examples in real life.
This will create reasons behind the formulas enabling students to identify problems within them. For example, in multiplication of length and width to obtain an area, this can be correlated to real life examples such amount of paint to apply on a classroom wall.
On the other hand, when adding length twice and width twice to get the perimeter of a rectangle, this can be correlated with measurement of a fence around a piece of land. Thus math will become less threatening to the student as they will view it as real life phenomenon. Moreover, integrating the examples with multiplication and addition will assist the students in reinforcement of these concepts.




","The concept of multiplication is a fundamental mathematical operation that is essential for solving a wide range of problems in fields such as science, engineering, economics, and more. In this essay, we will explore the concept of multiplication, its basic principles, and some of its applications.

Multiplication is a mathematical operation that involves combining two or more numbers to get a result that is larger than any of the individual numbers. The result of a multiplication operation is known as the product. The operation is represented by the symbol “×” or “*”, and the numbers being multiplied are called the factors.

One of the basic principles of multiplication is the commutative property, which states that the order of the factors does not affect the product. For example, 3 × 5 = 5 × 3 = 15. Another important principle is the associative property, which states that the grouping of the factors does not affect the product. For example, (2 × 3) × 4 = 2 × (3 × 4) = 24.

Multiplication can be performed using various methods, including mental calculations, paper and pencil, or a calculator. One of the most common methods is the long multiplication algorithm, which involves breaking down the factors into digits and multiplying them one by one.

Multiplication is often used in combination with other mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, and division. For example, in order to find the total cost of three items that cost $2.50 each, we can use multiplication to find the total cost: 3 × $2.50 = $7.50. Similarly, in order to calculate the area of a rectangle, we multiply the length by the width: area = length × width.

One of the most important applications of multiplication is in the field of algebra, where it is used to solve equations and manipulate expressions. For example, in the equation 2x + 3 = 7, we can use multiplication to isolate the variable x: 2x = 4, x = 2. Similarly, in the expression 3x(2x + 5), we can use multiplication to distribute the 3x to the terms inside the parentheses: 6x^2 + 15x.

Multiplication is also used extensively in geometry, where it is used to calculate the area and volume of shapes. For example, in order to find the volume of a rectangular prism, we multiply the length, width, and height: volume = length × width × height. Similarly, in order to find the area of a circle, we multiply the radius squared by pi: area = πr^2.

In statistics, multiplication is used to calculate probabilities and to find the expected value of a random variable. For example, in order to find the probability of getting two heads in a row when flipping a coin, we multiply the probability of getting a head (1/2) by the probability of getting another head (1/2): (1/2) × (1/2) = 1/4. Similarly, in order to find the expected value of rolling a six-sided die, we multiply each possible outcome by its probability and then add them up: (1/6) × 1 + (1/6) × 2 + (1/6) × 3 + (1/6) × 4 + (1/6) × 5 + (1/6) × 6 = 3.5.

In conclusion, multiplication is a fundamental mathematical operation that is used extensively in a wide range of fields. Its basic principles, such as the commutative and associative properties, make it a powerful tool for solving problems and manipulating equations. Its applications in algebra, geometry, and statistics, among other areas, make it a critical component of mathematical understanding. Moreover, the concept of multiplication extends beyond just arithmetic and into higher mathematics such as calculus, number theory, and abstract algebra.

In calculus, multiplication plays a key role in finding the derivative of a function. For example, the derivative of the function f(x) = x^2 is found by multiplying the coefficient 2 by the original exponent 2, resulting in the derivative f'(x) = 2x.

In number theory, multiplication is used to define prime numbers, which are integers that can only be divided by 1 and themselves. Prime numbers are the building blocks of many mathematical concepts, such as factorization and the RSA algorithm for cryptography.

In abstract algebra, multiplication is defined more broadly than just arithmetic. Instead of working with specific numbers, abstract algebra studies structures that behave like multiplication. For example, in the field of group theory, multiplication is defined as an operation between elements of a group that satisfies certain axioms.

In addition to these more advanced applications, the concept of multiplication is also important for everyday life. Whether calculating a tip at a restaurant or determining the cost of materials for a construction project, multiplication is an essential tool for making accurate calculations.

Overall, the concept of multiplication is a fundamental building block of mathematics with wide-ranging applications in many fields. Understanding its basic principles and how to apply them is crucial for success in math and other areas of life that require numerical reasoning.",Expository,
